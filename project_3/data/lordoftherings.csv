lordoftherings,Everything the RoP showrunners have said in interviews so far.,"Some common critiques fans have for the showrunners of the Rings of Power, Payne and McKay, include 1) they don't know or respect Tolkien's books; 2) they are too inexperienced and under-qualified for a show like this; 3) they're trying to do a fanfiction that brings modern politics into it. While we may not know the validity of these critiques until we see the show, many of the ""quotes"" circulating online that are claimed to be from the showrunners are often misattributed to them, misrepresented/misinterpreted, taken out of context, or even fabricated. Everyone can draw their own conclusion from what the showrunners say, but it is in everyone's interest if we are at least talking about actual quotes from the showrunners within proper contexts. Despite the fact that they've actually done quite a few interviews in recent months, we usually only see  fans focusing on two or three things the showrunners supposedly said (which is not always true). Reading a wider range of their actual quotes will hopefully give people a better and fuller idea of what the showrunners' actual attitudes and approaches are.

So in this post, I tried to collate a list of everything the showrunners have said in interviews regarding this show. In a few cases, I also included what others working on the show said about them. Direct quotes from or about the showrunners will be **bold**. If I'm missing any interviews, let me know and I'll add them.

# 1. [Amazon’s Lord of the Rings Series Rises: Inside The Rings of Power](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/02/amazon-the-rings-of-power-series-first-look), Vanity Fair, Feb 10.

&gt;All this will center, eventually, around the incident that gives the trilogy its name. “**The forging of the rings,**” says McKay. “**Rings for the elves, rings for dwarves, rings for men, and then the one ring Sauron used to deceive them all. It’s the story of the creation of all those powers, where they came from, and what they did to each of those races.**” The driving question behind the production, he adds, was this: “**Can we come up with the novel Tolkien never wrote and do it as the mega-event series that could only happen now?**”

Context: they were talking about when COVID first hit in 2020 and everyone started to panic a little, but then:

&gt;But one by one, the crew put down their phones. “**Everyone was crowding around the monitor as we’re doing this close-up where Galadriel’s face fills the screen and she cries, and she decides:** ***I have to fight,***” says McKay. As soon as the scene ended, the soundstage erupted in cheers. “**It’s a perfect example of how Tolkien and Middle-earth have a way of finding you, even in the darkest and most uncertain moments**,” says Payne.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*The Rings of Power* is their first credited IMDB listing. They know—it’s astounding to them too. “**We’ve worked on so many projects with so many awesome and exciting people that never got made or worked on things that did get made and we didn’t get credit,**” says McKay. “**We were a little bit of a dark horse. And Amazon talked to absolutely everybody—whoever had any idea for** ***Lord of the Rings.***” Adds Payne: “**We were passionate about the material and had a take that matched Amazon’s appetites and ambition.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**We felt like hobbits,**” Payne says. “**We felt like two very small people in a very big world who had just been entrusted with something that meant so much to so many different people.**” The showrunners found themselves quoting Frodo’s famous line from the end of *The Fellowship of the Ring.* “**Patrick and I will often look at each other in challenging moments of the show and say, ‘I’m glad you’re with me, Sam.’** ” “**He’s Sam,**” McKay adds. “**Just kidding,** ***I’m*** **Sam.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Bayona \[director of the first two episodes\] was attracted not just by the duo’s script but by their willingness to accept advice. “**From the very beginning, I trusted these guys,**” Bayona says. “**I knew what they were going through and they knew what I was going through also, because can you imagine going back to such a beloved world and \[facing\] the high bar of the Peter Jackson movies? We were, all the time, very aware of the massive expectations.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As lifelong genre fans, Payne and McKay understand the anxiety some feel about the show. “**We know what it’s like to be anticipating something and to be terrified that it won’t be what you hope**,” says McKay. “**We’ve been those guys many times over.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;McKay says the goal was “**to make a show for everyone, for kids who are 11, 12, and 13, even though sometimes they might have to pull the blanket up over their eyes if it’s a little too scary. We talked about the tone in Tolkien’s books. This is material that is sometimes scary—and sometimes very intense, sometimes quite political, sometimes quite sophisticated—but it’s also heartwarming and life-affirming and optimistic. It’s about friendship and it’s about brotherhood and underdogs overcoming great darkness.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**One of the very specific things the texts say is that hobbits never did anything historic or noteworthy before the Third Age,**” says McKay. “**But really, does it feel like Middle-earth if you don’t have hobbits or something like hobbits in it?**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It \[time compression\] is their biggest deviation from the text, and they know it’s a big swing. “**We talked with the Tolkien estate,**” says Payne. “**If you are true to the exact letter of the law, you are going to be telling a story in which your human characters are dying off every season because you’re jumping 200 years in time, and then you’re not meeting really big, important canon characters until season four. Look, there might be some fans who want us to do a documentary of Middle-earth, but we’re going to tell one story that unites all these things.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The showrunners clearly have great respect for Tolkien, but you can’t make a 50-hour adaptation without taking creative risks. “**We think the work will eventually speak for itself,**” Payne says when asked if fan concern and speculation ever unnerves him. “**Before an orchestra starts, audiences will talk to each other, but then as soon as the music begins, you’re in and you’re listening to that music.**”

# 2. [10 Burning Questions About Amazon’s The Rings of Power](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/02/10-burning-questions-about-amazons-the-rings-of-power), Vanity Fair, Feb 14.

&gt;In creating this new story, McKay and Payne’s goal was, in McKay’s words, “**different but familiar.**” While the series is not a precise continuation of Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings, it shouldn’t clash with the cinematic world fans have come to know and love.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**We were very lucky to have some alums that had experience in Middle-earth come back in**,” Payne says. “**We were the beneficiaries of their experience of having worked in Middle-earth before. We reached out to Peter \[Jackson\], but between COVID and his schedules and our schedules, didn’t manage to actually ever get together for coffee, but certainly would love to at some point.**” McKay adds, “**Our only relationship is as big fans and admirers.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The pair were quick to point out that the Jackson films were not their only inspiration. “**The universe that this show wants to be in is Tolkien’s—and that’s an umbrella over Peter’s films—and** **Led Zeppelin**\*\*, John Howe’s paintings, and\*\* ***The Hobbit*** **cartoon**,” McKay says.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;McKay and Payne had a keen interest in practical effects and real-world locations, which didn’t always align with their (admittedly enormous) budget. “**An example would be Khazad-dûm,**” Payne says. The duo wanted to shoot the dwarven mining city under an actual mountain in New Zealand. “**There’s this place called** **the Lost World**\*\*…that has this whole ecosystem and is absolutely crazy\*\*,” Payne says. The practicalities of trying to spelunk their cast and 300 crew members soon put that idea to rest. Instead, they built a lavish version on a soundstage.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Payne recalls their visual effects coordinator saying, “Do you want to know what the single most complicated scene that you’ve written in season one is? It’s a scene in which the elf and the dwarf walk down a hallway together.”   
&gt;  
&gt;McKays says, “**You have to shoot everything twice. It ends up being like an SAT problem where a hobbit and a dwarf and a man and an elf each leave a train station traveling at X miles per hour. Who is going to get to Mount Doom first? So it will be down to the millimeter, mimicking the exact same moves, and then the two things get spliced together and create this effect of one person being taller and smaller. We have a group of actual wizards that work on the show and they came up with a huge bag of tricks in which we are constantly able to keep the audience guessing.**” Payne promises they will be using “**every single trick in the book—old school, new school, everything—in a way that we are told no one has attempted.**” Some of the stranger monsters may be digital confections, but when orc-like baddies attack *The Rings of Power* heroes, it’s guys in suits, not piles of pixels.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So what did Amazon buy? “**We have the rights solely to** ***The Fellowship of the Ring***\*\*,\*\* ***The Two Towers***\*\*,\*\* ***The Return of the King***\*\*, the appendices, and\*\* ***The Hobbit***,” Payne says. “**And that is it. We do not have the rights to** ***The Silmarillion***\*\*,\*\* ***Unfinished Tales***\*\*,\*\* ***The History of Middle-earth***\*\*, or any of those other books.\*\*” That takes a huge chunk of lore off the table and has left Tolkien fans wondering how this duo plans to tell a Second Age story without access to those materials. “**There’s a version of everything we need for the Second Age in the books we have the rights to**,” McKay says. “**As long as we’re painting within those lines and not egregiously contradicting something we don’t have the rights to, there’s a lot of leeway and room to dramatize and tell some of the best stories that \[Tolkien\] ever came up with**.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**We took all these little clues and thought of them as stars in the sky that we then connected to write the novel that Tolkien never wrote about the Second Age**,” Payne says. The duo cites songs like “The Fall of Gil-galad” or “The Song of Eärendil” or *Fellowship* chapters like “The Council of Elrond” and “The Shadow of the Past” or the “Concerning Hobbits” section of the prologue as sources for significant lore dumps.  
&gt;  
&gt;“**We worked in conjunction with world-renowned Tolkien scholars and the Tolkien estate to make sure that the ways we connected the dots were Tolkienian and gelled with the experts’ and the estate’s understanding of the material**,” Payne says.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Here’s where their love for Tolkien’s language came into play. “**We start every single day of our writers room with a quote from the books**,” Payne says. “**Every day in production a quote from the books gets emailed out.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In studying the language from the first three episodes Amazon let *Vanity Fair* screen, we found a mix of cleverly repurposed lines of Tolkien’s dialogue as well as a few snatches of Biblical text. “**Both Patrick and I have religious backgrounds,**” Payne says. “**I spent a lot of time just reading those sacred texts. I was an English major at Yale and loved Shakespeare at the time and still go back and reread the various plays. I’ve also spent a lot of time studying Hebrew poetry and parallelism and inverted parallelism and chiasmus and all these cool rhetorical strategies that poets and prophets from thousands of years ago would use to communicate sacred material. And Tolkien, sometimes, will play in that kind of a sandbox.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;McKay explains that they tailored the dialogue to fit each kind of character. The harfoots speak with an Irish lilt whereas the elves speak in elevated British phrases. “**We even came up with hero meters for each different race in Tolkien**,” Payne says. “**Some of them will speak in iambs. Some of them will speak in dactyls. Some of them will speak in trochees.**” That in-depth approach might please Professor Tolkien, whose specialty was philology, a.k.a. the history of language.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;McKay and Payne have spent a long time thinking about Tolkien’s themes. McKay points out that Peter Jackson nailed exactly the tone they’re chasing: “**What I loved about those first three films in particular \[was\] Peter and his collaborators captured…a unique blend of tones that Tolkien \[uses\] in his characters and his worlds. It’s heartfelt but it’s complex and political. It’s dark and intense, but it’s also whimsical and funny and sweet. It’s very rare to find an author who, in any medium, tries to play every note on the piano. Sometimes it’s suspenseful, sometimes it’s scary, sometimes it’s esoteric and complex and wildly imaginative, but it’s all Middle-earth.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**We told Amazon we wanted to do four or five stories that are the big epics of the Second Age,**” McKay says, starting with “**the forging of the rings.**” At the center of that origin is the famed elven smith Celebrimbor (Charles Edwards) and Aramayos’s younger Elrond. In Eregion, Elrond is working to rebuild damaged alliances with the dwarves, including with his old friend, Prince Durin IV. “**We’re going back thousands of years to when the party was in full swing**,” McKay says. “**We’re going to see the elf capital of Lindon where Elrond is a young up-and-coming operator within the political scene of the high elves during their glory day.**” Lindon, with its golden autumn leaves and rocky shores, allowed Payne and McKay to expand on the beautiful New Zealand vistas Jackson captured for his film. “**We wanted to go to coastlines,**” McKay says. “**You’ve never seen the coastline of Middle-earth onscreen before**.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As for reconciling the idea of a young Elrond eager to make alliances with the closed-off version Hugo Weaving played in the Jackson films, Payne says that’s just part of the journey: “**Elrond, we know from the Third Age, has a pretty bleak view on humans. He says, ‘Men are weak’ because he’s seen the foibles of humankind. In some ways the Third Age is almost postapocalyptic Middle-earth. The elves have one foot out the door…. We’re going to watch as Elrond goes from optimistic to a bit more world-weary.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The second big story on McKay and Payne’s agenda is “**the rise of Sauron himself, when he was a physical villain,**” says McKay.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This, Payne says, is the third story on their list: “**the rise and fall of the island kingdom of Númenor.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**You meet Isildur and he’s like Michael Corleone,**” McKay says. “**He’s the young member of the family who has optimism and immaturity. Trace that guy to the tragic, final decision rather than the mistake of a fool.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;All of those stories will unfold over the course of several seasons, but the first season, McKay says, is all about the heroes: “**We didn’t want to do a villain-centric thing. We wanted it to be about introducing these worlds and the peoples who dwell in them and the major heroes and characters, some of whom you know, and some of whom are new. Season two we go a little bit deeper into the lore and the stories people have been waiting to hear.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**She’s full of piss and vinegar and she’s got a sword that’s broken because she’s killed so many orcs,**” McKay says of their version. “**This young hot-headed Galadriel…how did she ever become that elder stateswoman?**” What’s more important than Galadriel’s armor and weaponry is the turmoil of emotions we see raging inside her, having already survived multiple attacks by Sauron and his predecessor, Morgoth, and losing her brothers in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When asked if this might be Gandalf, Radagast, or Saruman, McKay answered cautiously, “**Well, I would say those are not the only beings, those names, in that class. So maybe, but maybe not. And the mystery and the journey of it is all of the fun, I would say.**” 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Payne adds, “**There are tiny little nods to Tolkien that could send you this way or send you that way. And we are hoping people will like taking that and putting together a huge puzzle.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What is known for certain is that this mystery man’s story connects to the harfoot character Nori Brandyfoot (Markella Kavenagh), seen in the Super Bowl teaser. “**Powers can be used for good or bad, and harfoots have rules that you’re not supposed to engage with the big folk,**” McKay says.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But it’s important to remember that Tolkien himself envisioned a number of different people telling stories set in his world. “**In his letter to Milton Waldman, it’s** **letter 131**\*\*,**” Payne says, “**\[Tolkien\] said he wanted to create an interconnected mythology that still would leave room for ‘other minds and hands wielding paint and music and drama.’ He wanted other artists to come after him and continue to push the boundaries of expanding what Middle-earth could be. It’s a terrifying but awesome responsibility to take the man himself up on his wish and continue his work in building out Middle-earth.\*\*”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**We’ve been given something…a stewardship,**” Payne says. “**People have been in Middle-earth before us, wonderful artists who have brought Middle-earth to life in a variety of different mediums and different ways. People will be here after us, but right now we are the ones who have been given this torch to carry \[and\] to work alongside Tolkien himself in a very real way**.”

# 3. World Exclusive: We look at The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power -- The biggest show of all time, Empire, July issue (paywalled).

&gt;“**We really did feel a lot like Frodo and Sam being handed the Ring,**” laughs JD Payne, recalling the day he and Patrick McKay — childhood friends from McLean, Virginia — received the news they were being entrusted with writing a new chapter in the grandest fantasy mythology the world has ever known.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**There were so many people who pitched for this show with résumés that, on paper, were more suited to an endeavour of this magnitude**,” admits McKay, addressing the Mûmakil in the room: that he and Payne, with only a few credits to their name, for rewrites on movies like *Star Trek Beyond* and *Jungle Cruise*, were embarking on this mission as relative unknowns. And like Samwise and Frodo, these showrunners would be completing their quest under an Eye Of Sauron-level-intense watchful glare.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**We didn’t want to do the TV version of** ***Lord Of The Rings***,” says McKay. “**We wanted to do a story in Middle-earth that deserves its own space on the shelf, alongside the novels and films**.” Payne agrees: “**We had to ensure we were bringing something fresh to it and expanding the map. We weren’t interested in a sequel or prequel or a rehash or nostalgia. It had to stand on its own two feet as something that felt faithful — but also its own thing**.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The events depicted in *The Lord Of The Rings* are a speck of sand in the hourglass of the timeline of Middle-earth, explains Payne: “**Tolkien’s legendarium is this enormous tapestry that stretches 9,000 years.**” In the beginning was the First Age: centuries of bloodshed as Elves did battle with Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. The Third Age is the era explored in *The Lord Of The Rings*’ The War Of The Ring and all the events of Jackson’s films. Bang in the middle is The Second Age, a time that “**contains some of the greatest stories from Tolkien’s mythos,**” Payne continues. “**It’s the story fans have always wanted to see fleshed out, but until now has only really been told in whispers.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**It was like Tolkien put some stars in the sky and let us make out the constellations**,” Payne explains, poetically. “**In his letters \[particularly in one to his publisher\], Tolkien talked about wanting to leave behind a mythology that ‘left scope for other minds and hands, wielding the tools of paint, music and drama.’ We’re doing what Tolkien wanted. As long as we felt like every invention of ours was true to his essence, we knew we were on the right track**.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**Anyone approaching** ***Lord Of The Rings*** **on screen would be wrong not to think about how wonderfully right \[Jackson\] got so much of it**,” McKay tells *Empire* in our world-exclusive new cover feature. “**But we’re admirers from afar, that’s it.** ***The Rings Of Power*** **doesn’t try to compete with him**.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**The siege at Helm’s Deep is so iconic and amazing that it was like, ‘What’s a different thing that we can do that still feels like Middle-earth but is unique for this story?’**” asks Payne. “**The show has a lot of action in it — more so than any television or streaming show that we’ve seen. Every episode has set-pieces, creatures, battles and white-knuckle fights to the death,**” adds McKay. “B**ut instead of having 10,000 Orcs fighting 10,000 men, what’s it like to have one Orc in your face, in your kitchen? What’s it like trying to kill an Orc when you’ve never killed an Orc before?**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When is a TV series not a TV series? When it’s a 50-hour movie. “**That’s really how we’ve approached** ***The Rings Of Power***\*\*,\*\*” says McKay, explaining how — unlike practically all other TV shows, which survive from season to season based on ratings — Amazon have already commissioned five seasons, which the duo have already mapped out in full. “**We even know what our final shot of the last episode is going to be**,” teases Payne. “**The rights that Amazon bought were for a 50-hour show. They knew from the beginning that was the size of the canvas — this was a big story with a clear beginning, middle and end. There are things in the first season that don’t pay off until Season 5.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is that what the biggest budget ever for a single season of TV buys you, then? “**Well…**” laughs Payne, without confirming or denying the reported numbers. “**We think it’s important to keep the budget in context. Really, this \[season\] is an eight-hour movie. This is the length of three Marvel films, done on the schedule of two, for the budget of one. Look at it in the context of what’s actually being produced and you could say that it’s a bargain.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**You can psych yourself out in keeping up with the Joneses, but one of the mantras on this was ‘go back to the source material’,**” McKay explains. “**What would Tolkien do?**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**Some of these other competing properties – they play one octave really beautifully,**” says McKay. “**But Tolkien was playing every note on the piano. He had that variety of tones. There’s the whimsy, friendship and humour that** ***Harry Potter*** **is so beloved for – but there’s sophistication, politics, history, mythology and depth, too. So for us, it was about going deeper into what we are, rather than worrying about what other folks are doing.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**We’re dealing with one of the greatest villains that’s ever been created in Sauron**,” says Payne. “**And one of the central figures in the story is the character of Celebrimbor \[Charles Edwards\]. He’s an Elven smith who was manipulated into helping create the Rings Of Power. We’re excited to be bringing him to Middle-earth. He’s very mysterious.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Gloom is baked into *The Lord Of The Rings*, the first seeds of which were born when Tolkien was fighting at the Somme in World War I. “**But part of what makes these stories so special,” McKay says, “is their optimism and life-affirming humanism**.” Payne nods in agreement: “***Lord Of The Rings*** **doesn’t skirt over the darkness. It takes you to the steps of Cirith Ungol and the lair of Shelob, where friends are betraying each other and characters are being dragged into Mordor. It’s a harrowing experience you go through. But in the end, there’s always a star in the sky that says, ‘Keep going.’ We wanted to find that spirit in this series.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“**The pressure would drive us insane if we didn’t feel like there was a story here that didn’t come from us. It comes from a bigger place**,” says McKay. “**It came from Tolkien and we’re just the stewards of it. We trust those ideas so deeply, because they’re not ours. We’re custodians, at best.**”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The pair take the Frodo and Sam analogy for one last spin before they depart, to explain their hopes for the future of their defiantly different take on Tolkien. “**Right now, it feels like we’re making our way up the mountain. The question has been: what happens when we get to the top?**” says McKay. “**Now I realise, that’s where the real adventure begins.**”

# 4. LOTR: The Rings of Power promises to bring a whole new kind of epic, Empire, summer issue (paywalled).

&gt;“I was convinced the *Hobbit* trilogy would be the last we’d see of Middle-earth on film,” \[John\] Howe admits, explaining that it took an exciting new approach to *Lord Of The Rings* lore to unlock a story worth telling. “**There’s a respect for Tolkien that’s an integral part of the showrunners’ approach**,” he says, nodding to the show’s creators, J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay. “**I appreciated their desire to take this material that’s difficult to bring to the screen and do something new with it.**”

# 5. [Exclusive First Look at the Orcs From Prime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-orcs-exclusive), IGN, June 21.

&gt;“**Well, I love Orcs,**” Weber \[executive producer\] starts. “**I love creature design, so I'm very happy to talk about this stuff. JD and Patrick — the showrunners — the very first page of their bible was about Orcs. They have a real passion for them, they love practical prosthetics and design, and they felt that they needed exploration given that this is the Second Age and thousands of years before the events of the Third Age. It was really important to them to treat them as their own culture and explore their world on its own two legs in its own right.**”

# 6. [Welcome to Númenor: Get an exclusive look at The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power](https://ew.com/tv/lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-numenor-first-look/), Entertainment Weekly, July 13.

&gt;That devoted fandom is why Payne and McKay pondered every tiny detail on *The Rings of Power* — right down to each stone in Númenor. ""**It was one place that we were just laser-focused on saying, 'We need to get this right,**'"" Payne explains. ""**It's never been seen before. People have some ideas of what elves look like or what dwarves look like and what those kingdoms might look like. But Númenor was, in some ways, a blank canvas.**""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""**We did not have the résumé that might make a studio head think we were a natural choice for this,**"" McKay admits. ""**We went up for it, basically saying, 'Well, let's leave everything on the field and see what happens.**'"" Despite their relative inexperience, Payne and McKay were lifelong Tolkien geeks, and their pitch centered on a story they themselves had always wanted to see on screen: the Second Age.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""**We were not interested in doing a show about the younger version of the same world you knew, where it's a little bit of a prequel**,"" McKay explains. ""**We wanted to go way, way, way back and find a story that could exist on its own two feet. This was one that we felt hadn't been told on the level and the scale and with the depth that we felt it deserved.**""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When it came to inventing new details like Eärien, McKay and Payne say they and the writers' room approached the task almost like historians, poring over Tolkien's work to ""excavate"" details and common threads they could weave into a larger narrative.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""**We feel like we're taking up the gauntlet that he \[Tolkien\] himself put down,**"" Payne adds. ""**He gave us what we like to say are the stars in the sky that we have to connect and draw the constellation in.**""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Still, the two writers hope audiences embrace the Second Age as much as they have. Their goal, they say, was to craft a series that appealed to both hardcore fans who can order their morning coffee in Elvish and newbies who ""**don't even know what a ring is.**"" ""**It needs to feel the way you feel when you are in Middle-earth,**"" McKay explains. ""**It needs to pull you in and make you fall in love the way you fall in love with those books.**""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""**If people come out of this feeling like they've gone to Middle-earth, that's such a special thing,**"" Payne adds. ""**Middle-earth fills us with hope, and it inspires us. There's a reason why people reach to Middle-earth when they're going through hard times.**""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As Tolkien himself put it, their quest stands upon the edge of a knife. But even now, there is hope left: Amazon recently screened about 20 minutes of the show for a group of Tolkien superfans. As Payne and McKay hid in the back, they overheard one audience member say that the show ""felt like Middle-earth."" ""**As he said that, I was surprised by my own reaction,**"" Payne says, laughing. ""**I spontaneously burst into tears. I was like, 'That's all I wanted to have happen!**'"""

lordoftherings,If Tolkien himself most likely would have hated the Peter Jackson Films just like his son did then why do we care so much about his legacy supposedly being ruined and not doing what he would have wanted with Rings of Power?,This is a genuine question. I am not asking this in an angered tone or anything I am legitimately wondering why people are getting so anger over rings of power having not seen it yet and over the hobbit as well. Christopher tolkien said himself that he hated the Peter Jackson films so wouldn’t that say that J.R.R. Tolkien himself would’ve hated them as well? With that in mind why do people get so worried about defiling Tolkien’s legacy when in his eyes if he were still alive it probably already has been by the todays standards amazing Peter Jackson movies? You also have to put everything into context with when Tolkien and Christopher were born and lived most of their life and grew up. The people in their time would not have liked any of the fancy flashy CGI or even some of the older 1970s special effects but today people love them. So the. Why are people getting so angry and worried about it?

lordoftherings,Separatism among Tolkien fans,"I do not concern myself with modern-day problems, especially around social media, but lately bullshit as wormed itself into my escape from reality. In the previous months I have never seen such separatism among Tolkien fans. You fight like if there is something to win, while all I see a fanbase gone toxic about a company that can not admit they fucked up. 

A few months ago I have never heard anyone complaining about black elves and dwarves, and a sword-swinging Galadriel and all this other bs. Now, whenever I come to a *Tolkien website* all I see is a bunch of people arguing. As far as I am concerned Amazon is the cause of this squabble; they are the ones who are the true enemy. Amazon does not want to admit they are in trouble and separates us with woke propaganda (praising the pro-ROP lot as good people and scolding anti-ROP as Racists, Sexist and every-other -ist they can think of) out of spitefulness.  

Why do you-all allow this Company to separate you? Why do you-all allow consumerism corrupt you like this? They do not care if you're fan, they do not care about the lore... they care about milking you for money."

Realistically our entire theory of our universe has moved (through string theory) into essentially an understanding/hypothesizing that our entire universe follows the principles of music 

Essentially the mind of the creator is the music of the universe 

Now WHO do we know that literally wrote an entire mythos based off the ideology that the music of the creator was the literal embodiment of the physical universe of the mythos?

Tolkien was a gift to humanity and was so far ahead of his time he essentially postulated string theory and presented it to society (in a way that laymen could actually fathom) well before we could prove any of it 🤷‍♀️"

You are showing absolutely zero appreciation of the fact that there is actually something substantial being done with the Legendarium and that now more than ever will people watch LOTR content that isn't just the original trilogy.
2. I understand the frustration at not getting a 100% faithful adaptation of the Silmarillion, but this frustration is totally irrational. There is no other timeline where this happens. It is impossible. There is no such thing as a show that is 100% faithful to its adapted novel, ESPECIALLY the most expensive show ever made.
3. Completely unacceptable backlash at casting choices. Again, I get it, they aren't canon, but the fact that your criticism extends beyond just a simple observation just makes people think you're racist. I'm sorry, I really dont care if you think you aren't racist, the fact that a black Elf and a black Dwarf bothers you so much makes you look insecure, not righteous. This is how other people perceive you and the LOTR fandom, and if you do not want to be perceived as racist then maybe you can calm the fuck down and stop whining. Do you have any idea how many of my friends saw posts that called LOTR fans racist? 
4. You need to stop watching sensationalist YouTube channels that make it their full-time job to bash Rings of Power. They don't care about Tolkien, they only care about you angrily clicking on their video so they can make ad money. 
5. Finally, you have perverted Tolkien's work by gatekeeping it. The Legendarium is about good triumphing over hate, about all free people working together as a force of good to defeat the ultimate bad. And most importantly, how overcoming this evil is by being able to change and adapt. You people have only demonstrated you ability to hate while also your inability to change.

This will get deleted, but some of you need a reality check on this series. Right now, all you're accomplishing is defecating on Tolkien's legacy. From now on, when people think of Tolkien, they won't think of high fantasy, they'll think of his racist fans who despise diversity and think that change is impossible."

lordoftherings,Question about Isildur and Elrond when Elrond recites when he saw the strength of men fail…,"When Elrond is narrating to Gandalf when he was with Isildur at the edge of Mount Doom…and we all know Isildur says “no…” when he hears “cast it into the fire!” from Elrond…my question is…as wise and as knowledgable as Elrond is…since he knew the doom the One Ring would bring upon Middle Earth if not destroyed…and when he saw Isildur turn his back and start walking away casually in his greed…*why* didn’t Elrond just push Isildur off the edge? He was only about 15 feet away from Elrond…he wouldn’t even see it coming from behind…

The ring would of went flying off with Isildur plummeting to his death if Elrond just ran and shoved him off…that would of been the end of it right there…that’s what I don’t get? The stakes were so high and Elrond just let him walk away with it like, “welp…we’ll just worry about this change of events later…”

Where’s the logic to this? I would of sacrificed his death if it meant the ring would be destroyed. 

You gotta do what you gotta do in high stakes. Elrond did nothing when it counted the most."

I want to become a Tolkien superfan and was wondering what the best things to read after the big 5 (Hobbit, Lotr trilogy, and The Silmarillion) are. Basically what the best books are to read in the LOTR universe after that. Thanks!"
lordoftherings,I literally cannot describe what a delight I feel to have this!!,
lordoftherings,What is your favorite passage/quote from the books?,"For me it will always be this

Lord of the Rings, Book V, Chapter V: Ride of the Rohirrim

At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:

*Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!
Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!
spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,
a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!
Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!*

With that he seized a great horn from Guthláf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.
*Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!*
Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Éomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first éored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Théoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City."

To me, it seemed that every since Sauron forged the original rings (and brought the Great War, and then obviously the ring is lost and then Frodo) that middle earth has been in a sort of dark ages. Everywhere is covered in ruins and by the stories and some of the lore it sounds like middle earth use to be filled with great and large civilizations that have not really recovered beyond single cities or small holdings

lordoftherings,Could Sauron have forged indestructible armor/weapons instead of rings?,"Apologies in advance because I'm not a LotR expert by any means.

My understanding is that the One Ring can't be destroyed because it was forged in the fires of Mt Doom, and no other heat source in Middle Earth is powerful enough to destroy the ring. It can only be destroyed where it was made. And that makes more or less sense. All right.

But then... why make a ring? Okay, I understand it was to bend the will of the kings of Middle-Earth to Sauron's will. That was a great plan. But obviously, it didn't pan out except for the Ringwraiths. But why didn't Sauron say to himself, ""Hey wait. This ring is totally indestructible. Why don't I make... armor with it?""

I imagine that if Sauron had forged himself indestructible armor that could only be destroyed in Mt Doom, and he'd been wearing that armor when Isildur had cut his finger off, then Sauron would literally have been unstoppable. No way to cut through the indestructible gauntlet. No way to separate him from the One Ring. So... Yeah, actually pretty awesome.

I thought at first, well maybe he couldn't enchant something that big? But then, the ring magically changes sizes for whomever is trying to wear it. Couldn't he just make it magically embiggen itself to be a gauntlet? Or a full suit of armor?"

I've seen others post about similar shows here so when I found out they were selling tickets within a reasonable distance from me, I quickly bought two and planned a little trip for my husband and I (we live in Connecticut).  They are good tickets in section 24 of the Blossom Theater.

On a whim, I decided today to splurge on two box seats.  I now have the two original tickets that need new owners.  I paid $75 each but am more than willing to sell them half price as I know that anyone seeing this will really appreciate the experience.

We know Vecna is not dead at the end of the season,  he’s just retreated the same way Sauron did to Dol Guldur.

-If the ainur can’t die then did Sauron die or just couldn’t take a corporal form anymore? If he did fully die is it because he poured so much of his power into the one ring that he couldn’t exist without it?

lordoftherings,Ranking the main characters,"Hello

I recently watched the LOTR movies for the first time, and with no previous experience with the LOTR series, I have a few opinions that I would like to discuss and see what the community thinks! I actually really enjoyed the movies, but I couldn't get over the fact that Frodo Baggins was portrayed as such an incompetent protagonist. My friend said the movies did Frodo dirty and the books allowed Frodo to be more heroic, but having never read the books I can't speak on that myself. I don't know, I just had a problem with Frodo needing to be rescued at every turn by whatever other protagonist was available and then being able to reap the most rewards by the end of the third movie. I am curious to hear what more experienced LOTR community members think, maybe I'm crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR after my first experience with LOTR I couldn't justify putting Frodo in the top 10 of characters in the movie who were most important in the destruction of the ring."

Battles were least important to Tolkien, yet we get Xena Galadriel. Commander, NEVER in the books. 
Eowyn, a lowly human had to dress like a man and sneak in to PF to fight.
Yet Galadriel a high noble Noldorian Elf, just walks around with chainmail and Swords.
She is 2000 years old, ppl act like you would have the mentality of a 20yr old human.
Short Hair is atrocious and inaccurate.
CGI looks Goofy at timesand very Game of Thrones ish
Haha Looks like Star of Feanor on Galadriel is like swastika on a Jew. 
2 Durins exist at same time
Time Compressed.
There were No Hobbits in SA.
99% of Actors look terrible.
Galadriel out to kill who killed her brother? Who could that be, maybe Sauron? Its no secret to the fandom, yet they say no Sauron in First Season.
Writers have ZERO experience. 
Jar Jar Abbrams Protoge.

Hobbit dub over makes no sense, Hobbits hate adventure.
Offical Trailer hit 3 million dislikes 120k likes.
Did dem Black Elves wit da Clipper cut go extinct by da TA?
Same for Black Dwarf and Hobbit and Numenorians?

I see 80% of comments made by ppl who ""will give it a chance""  never even Read Tolkien. Amazon only has rights to Appendices. Then they will try and bash PJs amazing adaption of a very complex novel.
PJ was also heavily against all the garbage added to the hobbit. Maybe look into it. 

Btw ppl do know artistic impressions exsisted during Tolkien and especially Christophers life, Tolkien even drew an elf and LONG Hair and they were ALL white. 

I think Tolkien and especially Christopher would have said something if there were supposed to be black elves,dwarves, hobbits and now Numenorians.

Tolkien based his world on Anglo Saxon, Celtic and Norse mythology. Not African,  Sorry 😐😐

Now after 70yr- the 2 blue wizards come in 1600SA instead of 1000TA.
Very odd.

Do Tolkien’s Elves have pointed ears?

Tolkien doesn’t often dwell on describing the minute physical details of his characters, so it is possible to read The Lord of the Rings and his other writings without noticing that either Elves or Hobbits have pointed ears. However, in a 1938 letter (No. 27, p. 35) to his American publishers Tolkien says Hobbits have “a round, jovial face; [with] ears only slightly pointed and ‘elvish.’” From this it is clear that Elvish ears were more obviously pointed. This was confirmed when The Lost Road was published in 1987. In the Etymologies under the first definition of ‘LAS’, which is the element in lasse meaning ‘leaf’, there is this note: “The Quendian ears were more pointed and leaf-shaped than Men""

[page references: The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, 1981 &amp; 2006; The Lost Road, 2002 UK paperback]

""Medium cannot be wholly different ; and the failure of poor films is often precisely in exaggeration, and in the intrusion of unwarranted matter owing to not perceiving where the core of the original lies.""

JRR Tolkien 

""I do earnestly hope that in the assignment of actual speeches to the characters they will be represented as I have presented them: in style and sentiment. I should resent perversion of the characters  even more than the spoiling of the plot and scenery.""

JRR Tolkien

Letter 45: Tolkien implies Middle Earth is Europe.

I have in this War a burning private grudge—which would probably make me a better soldier at 49 than I was at 22: against that ruddy little ignoramus Adolf Hitler (for the odd thing about demonic inspiration and impetus is that it in no way enhances the purely intellectual stature: it chiefly affects the mere will). Ruining, perverting, misapplying, and making for ever accursed, that noble northern spirit, a supreme contribution to Europe, which I have ever loved, and tried to present in its true light.

Numerous Paralells and Homages to European Culture, History and FolkTales.

It is very disturbing the biggest Tolkien fans are the ones destroying his work. Scholars, Tolkien Websites, Tolkien YT Channels, Facebook Groups, Tolkien Society, Hell even the Estate.
Tolkien is NOT just ""another fantasy author"". His works are sacred to people all over the world.
It spans a very rich legandarium including:  Creation, Poetry, Symbolism, Morals, Songs, Timeless themes, extensive world building, Religious inspiration and characters never seen since or before. This is why Tolkien is called the Father of Modern Fantasy.

Amazon and their cronies are uterlly disgusting sellouts to something very important to peoples of ALL races. We want HIS vision. Not some horrendous rewrite for The PC culture of 2022. I will NEVER watch this absolute mockery of a Legendary Man in life and author."

lordoftherings,Boromir is a good dude.,"Re-reading the books again, Boromir really gets a bad rap in the movies. I know that in order to make it seem like it wasn't completely out of the blue they need to establish Boromir as a bit shady, but I feel like the movies are just too short to do his character complete justice.

Here is a man, who has been fighting his entire life, non stop, on the borders of Mordor, and thinks of nothing other than protecting his people. I think he is incredibly noble, as the son of a steward he could very easily have just enjoyed his privileged life, but he works tirelessly for his city. 

I understand why they had to display his personality the way they did in the movies, but I do wish that they had been able to at least show his true strength a bit more. 

Anyways,

Imagine - after Gandalf's fall in Moria the Fellowship arrive in Lorien. Galadriel (and Elrond) decide that they should make the Fellowship number up to nine again, to match the Nazgul.

You are joining the Fellowship in Lorien. What kind of character are you? What race, where from? What weapon is your specialty? What will you bring to the Fellowship?

Myself - I would be a dismounted Rohirrim and represent Rohan amongst the Fellowship. I'd be well armoured, and carry a heavy spear, with a one-handed battle axe/hatchet at my belt, as well as a shield.

Tolkien addressed the issue of equality and feminism and showed Eowyn as a champion of equality in the third age and showed her overcoming social stigma of previous ages. But amazon wants to show that there were no issues of inequality right through second age. what a joke.

**Tolkien wrote a beautiful story arc for Eowyn showing her as a strong woman and her internal struggles and how she overcomes the social shackles and goes to war. (which was a very rare thing for a woman even in third age)** . Her fight to overcome this social stigma is such a crucial part of her character. But according to Amazon there was no social restriction and women were always a big part of armies of men. and **Eowyn was just doing drama and playing victim for attention.**

**Amazon wants to show Tolkien as stupid**. they want to show that women were always a big part of armies of race of men and that Eowyn was just an over dramatic Karen trying to deal with a non existent social problem of women not being allowed in armies of Men."

lordoftherings,Is The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power 'going woke' (updated),"I [had written about this topic early on](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/nu9nob/is_the_lord_of_the_rings_show_really_going_to_be/) during production on *The Rings of Power*, but I think now is the time for an overhauled version. So is *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power* ""going woke""? The short answer is yes, they are.

What does that term actually mean, though? Is it good or bad? How should we discuss such topics? and what repurcussions they may have going forward?

# Say, whatever is ""woke""?

""Woke"" become such a buzzword that its kind of lost its original meaning: for those who use it its often just that - a buzzword, the criticism of identity politics playing second fiddle to a basic need to grumble; for those who critique it, its also just a buzzword that belies traces of racism.

But what was it coined to mean? Well, ""woke"" is slang for ""awake"" in the sense of being awake to supposed racial and gender biases. For our purposes, a piece of media ""being woke"" means being crafted with a certain societal ideal in mind, which is the ideal of *equality of outcome:* an ideology according to which a truly egalitarian society will only exist when any subdivision of society - ergo any workplace and indeed every film cast - should exhibit the same demographic breakdown as that of the general populace: i.e. the amount of ""black"" people in a cast should be directly proportional to the amount of ""black"" people in society (or, at least, in the society producing the piece) and so on for women, and for other identity groups. A movie cast doesn't have to absolutely correspond to real-world demographics to point in this direction: any casting process within which a considerable amount of affirmative action had been at work could be concievably deemed ""woke.""

Its important to stress that this kind of equality is, currently, NOT the western ideal that's upheld by most democratic countries: the Western ideal is one of *equality of opportunity*: every *individual* should get as fair a shot at any position in society as possible, without it necessarily meaning that the finished result would be one where any subdivision within society will exhibit the same demographic breakdown as the whole. 

This is predicated on the assumption that, on average, Men and Women can, and are within their rights to, have different professional preferences. The argument as to whether these preferences derive from societal constructs or from something more innate, and how much, is usually not backed-up by scientific evidence in either direction, and while there is some academic discourse on the matter, science is probably never going definitively resolve this discourse in either direction.

Without getting too cerebral with this topic, it does have the caveat of how these identity groups are broken down, which is why I put ""black"" in quotation marks, because we're already seeing voices calling for equity for identity groups that are subdivisions of the ""black"" identity group, like decrying the [absence of MENA cast members](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/dune-appropriates-islamic-middle-eastern-tropes-real-inclusion-critics-rcna4111) among the black cast mebers of *Dune,* and the same could be said for other identity groups. Heck, this very show was criticized for creating diversity for black actors but not for Asian ones.

For the purposes of this essay, I'm going to focus on ethnic diversity, which in the context of this show means the inclusion of black actors, and not touch gender diversity, either in the main cast or in extras, [in spite of news of the extras in crowds like the Numenorean army being divided 50-50 between men and women.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LOTR_on_Prime/comments/vlayln/exclusive_new_leaks_about_numenor_army_dynamics/) I certainly don't think - canon compliance notwithstanding - that there's some inherent issue in making Galadriel something of a warrior.

Whether this new ""woke"" ideal is better or worst than our current one and should or shouldn't supplant it, is not the point: we could sit here for another year discussing just that without ever circling back to *The Lord of the Rings*, and that's not the point of this sub nor this post. The point is to illustrate that **yes, ""woke"" is an actual concept that describes a** ***disputed*** **sociopolitical agenda, and one that does seem to correspond with the way** ***The Rings of Power*** **was being cast.**

That isn't to say that *The Rings of Power* is driving towards an ***explicit*** political agenda: I REALLY don't think we'll see in the show - say - an anti-Trump message or a pro-vaccinations message of what have you: there's only a ""message"" insofar as it is implicit in the way the piece is cast.

# So, back to The Rings of Power...

But yes, *The Rings of Power* **IS** indeed ""woke"" insofar as it DEFINITELY utilized affirmative action or ""quotas"" in its casting process: [several of the roles were mandated in the casting process to be designated for a ""diverse"" actor or actress.](https://knightedgemedia.com/2020/01/exclusive-full-character-breakdowns-for-amazons-lord-of-the-rings-tv-series/) This was true of the roles of Bronwyn (Nazanin Boniadi) and, logically, her son Theo (Tyroe Muhaffidin) in the Harad storyline (which, in spite of being set in Harad or its outskirts, actually featured a mixed-race society, including a minor role for Peter Tait) and Tar Miriel (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) in the Numenore storyline. Its unknown but not unlikely the same is true of the role of Sadoc Burrows (Doctor Sir Lenworth Henry) from the Harfoot storyline.

That is not the same to say, I stress, that these people were cast strictly for their heritage: indeed, with Lenny Henry and Nazanin Boniadi we have some of the most distinguished members of the cast, and some of the roles like those of Arondir (Ismael Cruz-Cordova), Disa (Sophia Nomvete) and Marigold (Sara Zwangobani) were cast the way they are *without* a quota being enforced.

The only storyline that seems to be totally lacking ""diverse"" actors is the Lindon storyline, much of it probably due to the showrunners attempt to make their show ""not clash"" with the live-action films by casting actors who were, among other things, close in appearance to their movie counterparts: therefore, they were locked into the ethnicity of the movie actors, who were white caucasians (which [had, in turn, attracted some misplaced grumbles](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/09-12-2021/why-we-shouldnt-glorify-lord-of-the-rings)). Indeed, as far as well can tell, the only roles specifically calling for ""Caucasian"" actors are those roles that are reprised from *The Lord of the Rings*: Galadriel (Morfydd Clark), Elrond (Robert Aramayo), Gil galad (Benjamin Walker), Elendil (Lloyd Owen), Isildur (Maxim Baldry), as well as the latter's sister, Carine (Ema Horvath).

When the cast was first announced, many people had thought all these ""diverse"" actors were cast to portray Haradrim, Easterlings and the like. But from early on we had assumed this was not the case: one of the ""diverse"" roles smacked of being a Numenorean queen, and indeed turned out to be the role of Tar Miriel, played by Cynthia Addai-Robinson. More to the point still, this is Amazon's *main* cast, and they're playing *main* (or at least *major*) characters: they were never going to get cast only to be pigeon-holed into minor roles, and certainly not into strictly antagonistic roles.

I'm dredging this up because these discusions tend to devolve into a ""us versus them"" rhetoric on both sides, which I don't like: if you defend the woke casting to any extent, you're immediately an Amazon shill; and when you critique it, no matter how eloquently and considerably, someone is bound to call you a racist. Indeed, personally the thing that spurred me into writing this was this video: 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci\_rCqNYE-I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci_rCqNYE-I)

And I feel the need to state very emphatically that, by and large, **no, the people who defend the casting are not Amazon shills or ""evil commies"", and - just as importantly - the people critiquing it are not chauvinistic racists**. This is not only true because the people on the far opposite fringes of the argument are both probably a vocal minority, but also because **you don't have to be woke to accept a modicum of affirmative action, and you don't have to be a bigot to disagree with the societal views that stand behind explicitly ""woke"" casting.**

Are *some* people critiquing the show for ""wokeness"" racist? Damn straight. Some of the comments around Disa's look have been absolutely reviling, and make one feel bad for Sophia Nomvete. Are some of the people rallying *for* the woke casting and against ""racist"" fans part of the dreaded ""cancel culture""? Damn straight, too. I'm reminded of an egregious example that happened during Vanity Fair's Twitter event, in which a caller speaking in favour of the diverse casting effectivelly tried ot shame dissenting voices and say derisively that ""its a reflection on *you.*"" Neither of those two camps  should implicate the fandom as a whole. I think that to accuse the fandom at large of racism is a preposterous accusation that one better back-up with numbers if one (like TurfNation) is going to have the temerity to make it.

Honestly, I still think that, for a lot of the people on both sides of the fence, the socio-political thing is secondary to their inherent need to grumble and b!tch and moan about things: that would be true of YouTubers such as this TurfNation guy on the one hand, and of guys like George the Giant Slayer and Nerdrotic on the other. That is not, on the whole, a defense of those people: personally, I find croakers to be just as tedious as the crowd that actually does sit on the far ends of the equity discussion.

Certainly, there's some sanctimoniousness going on sometimes: it can even come from the cast itself. I grumbled on-air at Lenny Henry's statements to Empire on the supposed significance of his casting in a major fantasy show: I just don't think its the big statement he's making it out to be; and there had been those that have been equating the kind of arguments we're having today to voices that bellyached about the casting of the gay Sir Ian McKellen in 1999. 

That's of course a total canarad not just because those were extremly minor voices at the time, but also because that's totally unlike ethnic diversity: for one thing, McKellen being gay doesn't make Gandalf gay, whereas casting Idris Elba as James Bond (which I would have been totally fine with, had it come to pass - which it hadn't) does make Bond black. Really, diversity in the sexual orientation of characters is totally different to ethnic and even gender diversity insofar as its not readily appearant to the audience unless its made out to be.

On the other hand, there is a lot of ranting and frothing going on in the other side: I sometimes think that a lot of the people who are criticizing a lot of shows and films for being ""woke"" are in fact having more fundemental storytelling issues with those films and shows, but lack the wherewithal to express them, and so go for the buzzwords without necessarily understanding what they're saying: you see it a lot in YouTube comment sections where you'll get a succint ""woke shills"" comment without any explanation whatsoever.

On the whole, I still do think this is NOT a particularly ""toxic"" fandom in the sense that the amount of croaking (both on issues of diversity and more generally) is on the whole much more contained than it is over at the *Star Wars* fandom and, in recent years, the *Potter* fandom; and threads tend not to devolve into complete chaos of ad hominem accusations. One could perform a sociological study into why that is: something tells me its because the average age of a Lord of the Rings fan, weaned on books and movies generally aimed at an older demographic, is greater than that of the average Star Wars and Potter fan. But I digress.

At the very least, if we hope to have any fruitful discussions going forward, we ought to avoid reading smarminess into the messages of other Redditors, **assume good faith** and avoid ad-hominem attacks, including accusations against the integrity of others. At the same time, to have a fruitful discussion, one of must have *a discussion*: if the issue is just swept under the rug, it won't do much good. Does opening it up mean some people are going to see Reddit comments that they might have a hard time stomaching? Sure. But, beyond the requirement of basic Reddiquette, these communities are not intended as some sort of cushy ""safe spaces.""

Does it mean certain arguments are going to come-up repeatedly? Sure, but that's true of most major critiques of most major film and TV projects: there are a couple of main critiques that everyone tends to parrot over and over again, regardless of whether they anything to do with politics. At the same time, we also can't go on and on about the diversity thing like a looped tape: I hope this thread would be an outlet - a civilized, balanced (but not necessarily unheated) outlet - for most of people's hopes/fears regarding this topic for the near future, rather than having people constantly flooding all Lord of the Rings-related subs with it in the coming months.

# Is ""woke"" a problem?

Thus far, I have not taken a personal stance on the ""woke"" discussion in this writeup, and... I still won't. I will however point out that *The Lord of the Rings* is different to *Star Wars*, Marvel and other franchises in this regard, insofar as it has a lot more of the trappings of a period piece. Star Wars, in particular, had been actually allied with leftist ideals from the outset, the original film being in part an anti-Vietnam War parable.

When the casting news broke, people were quick to throw out a [quote of Sir Peter Jackson's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg):

&gt;Well, we didn't want to put any of our own - certainly, in terms of the thematic material - we didn't want to put any of our own ""baggage""; I mean, we had no interest in putting our messages into this movie, but we thought that we should honour Tolkien by putting his messages into it.

That's a very nice quote: its also...not entirely true. Its very common for filmmakers to say one thing and do something a little bit different: that doesn't make them disingenious - its just that how we explain a work of art and how we actually craft one are two totally different things.

Jackson does imbue his films with Tolkien's major themes - friendship, dichtomoy of good and evil, loss of innocence, death, environmentalism, leadership, etecetra - but he does so in his own way. For instance, in another interview Jackson says that, not being Catholic, he didn't ""put a lot of that"" into the movie. He also infused some of the characters with a very 20th-century kind of patriotism and gave all six films a strong theme of commentary on isolationism, which are his own themes.

However, the cast of his films is overwhelmingly white Caucasian, and this is in stark juxtaposition to other Jackson films - including *King Kong* the year after *The Lord of the Rings*, the Jackson-produced *Mortal Engines*, or even the undercurrent of Lesbianism in *Heavenly Creatures* \- all films which have fairly diverse casts. Indeed, its documented that early on, Jackson got into an argument with Robert Weinstein, who suggested that Morgan Freeman would make a good Gandalf.

Jackson and his co-writers/co-producers (Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens) did make allowances towards having more prominent female roles in his films, and Boyens had carried this over to *The War of the Rohirrim*, as well. But they did not  accomodate much by way of *ethnic* diversity, with the sole exception of Laketown, where it was reasoned that being a trading center on the verge of the far-east and north, it could hold people hailing from those regions.

This is significant because it brings us to another quote of Jackson's from earlier in the above interview:

&gt;What we'll do with the movie is we will pretend that this is history. Just as if we were making an ancient Roman film, or making *Braveheart* \- you know - about Sir William Wallace, you know. That, we'll pretend that these guys existed, its history, it was real. That, lets make the movie with that weight of authenticity, in the designs, the looks, the performances, everything.

Obviously, this too isn't a 1-to-1 description of the movies: they do resemble *Braveheart* and *Rob Roy* and *Gladiator*, but not in the same way that, say, *King Arthur* (2005) does, whereby the fantasy is completely historicized, which proved to be an exercise in futility. Nevertheless, there is a streak of romantic naturalism that runs through all six films, and that entails having the appearance of a Medieval film, which affects the casting. Its to some extent a cinematic convention, but so is the convention of having characters in period and fantasy films speak with a British accent, which is a convention Amazon did decide to keep.

I'm deliberately not going too deep into the Tolkien side of this: we can argue forever about what image Tolkien had in his mind about certain characters he described as ""swarthy"" but I think its indisputible that, on the whole, his works conjur up an ersatz-Medieval-European world. Ontop of that, however, its in the nature of adaptations to make changes, and so I try to approach this more *cinematically* and think about how it works visually, rather than get too deep into lore that may be tempered with like Jackson tempered with the Elves coming to Helm's Deep.

Honestly, from a pro-diversity standpoint, would it not have been better to cast diverse actors into cultures that are completely designed around that diversity, rather than transplating diverse actors into each storyline seemingly at random, and with the cultures of those storylines retaining a mostly Medieval Europe-flavoured design aesthetic, clashing with the casting rather than melding with it? Could that not be construed as a very superficial, tokenistic attempt at diversity?

I'm not going to take this argument as far as those people who say Amazon should have told some invented side-story that takens place entirely in Harad: they wanted to tell a major Tolkien story, mulling over the adventures of Young Aragorn before deciding on the events of the Second Age, and I'm glad they did: the stories of the Forging of the Rings and the Downfall of Numenore are worthy stories to put onscreen.

Certainly, having Tar Miriel be played by Addai-Robinson while her first cousin, Pharazon, is played by the ebony-white Trystan Gravelle is an unfortunate side-effect of these casting quotas. Can you *explain* it by giving a role to a ""diverse"" actress as Tar-Palantir's wife? Sure, but most films and shows would have simply circumnavigated the issue entirely by not blindly sticking to quotas.

Speaking of ""explaining"" the casting, I don't think they should. I don't doubt Amazon feel under no obligation to have an in-universe ""explanation"" for the heritage of the characters for whom they had cast diverse actors and actresses and - honestly - to try and explain why Disa or Arondir look they way they do will probably be more awkward and clumsy (to those wont to see it as awkward and clumsy) than to just have them be there.

There's also an authorship question: is this the will of the showrunners or the higher-ups? It seems to line-up with Bezos' desire to bring his media franchises ""into the 21st century"" but I think this is actually a case of symbiosis: the executives chose showrunners who are sympatico with their societal worldview and applying it to this show.

Honestly, personally, questions like why is Arondir's hair so bloody short or why the latent continuity with the live-action films is so half-arsed are ones that occupy my mind much more so than the whole ""woke"" thing; the colour palette of the cinematography probably interests me more than the colour palette of the cast.

# How to approach this?

And really, I think this sums up my own personal views on this, which is that while I do think this casting philosophy could have been more *refined*, I'm not going to let it dominate the way I view the show: if the storytelling is great, I'll love it; if the storytelling is mixed, I'll probably enjoy it with caveats; if the storytelling is bad, I'll dislike it with caveats. In all three cases, I'll probably seek to articulate my feelings online, but I won't make a point out of either gushing saccharine over the good parts, nor frothing at the corners of my mouth about the bad ones.

The issue is that if you approach this from a very strong ""woke trash"" point of view, you're all the more likely to *will it into* not being good, and therefore circling back to the ""woke trash"" outlook, and much the same could be said for the opposite viewpoint.

All I'm saying is, give the wretched thing a chance: just because a show might make you grumble or roll your eyes a couple of times, doesn't mean there isn't good stuff in it beyond that; and just because a critique of the show might make you grumble or roll your eyes, doesn't mean there aren't astute points being made in it."

lordoftherings,Amazon's Rings of Barber: The legendary middle earth Barbershop that even Tolkien wasn't aware of!," Im very excited to see the mysterious legendary barbershop in middle earth with modern day trimmers.

Theory:

While Galadriel was busy doing her piss and vinegar thing in numenor - The barbershop is what was responsible for peace between dwarves and elves.

It gave elves modern day fade haircuts while shaving dwarf women for free ! It revolutionized the lives of Dwarves and Elves by making Dwarf women look different from dwarf men and making male elves realize that they did not have to have to have loong hair like females.

Location:

I think this barbersop would be located between Khazad dum and celebrimbor's lands. (poor old celebrimbor wouldn't want to travel a lot just for a haircut that made him look all fancy like a walmart aisle manager from the future now, would he? )

Very curious - Will they show the perilous journey Arondir makes to get his supreme modern day fade haircut at the shop?

So little is written about elves making journeys for modern day haircuts but it surely must have happened right !?"

Then when they are getting lost in the forest, and all the scary stuff is happening, Merry is just like hey, it's cool, and shows 0 signs of fear what so ever.

Have you ever played this game?
It passed rather quietly, in Italy it is almost unknown.

There are some strange things in this game, for example:
1) I always noticed that Frodo at home Baggins looked at a pot and probably sometimes I must have tried to insert an egg (the one you should give to Fatty Bolger) But I found out that you can get a second if we observe the dog inside Sam’s house and then talk to Angelica Baggins in Bywater.
There’s no reaction from her, she’s gonna give us this egg like this, almost meaningless.
Then inserting one of the Athelas in the pot you get a potion to lengthen the life of Frodo. How is one supposed to figure it out on their own? 😅
2) Gandalf will find several pages of Mazarbul’s book but it is not possible to use them in any way. Only one will provide us with information but very confusing;
3) At Moria, Frodo after entering the Second Hall, towards the end of Moria, will meet Gimli who is facing some orcs. One of them will give us the Numenorean Sword but neither Gandalf or Aragorn or Frodo himself seem then to be able to use it;
4) after having already seen Gollum in Moria and on other occasions, one just at a campsite in Amon Hen but only if you talk to Frodo, you meet him after Aragorn has fought with the Uruk-Hai, the orcs and the goblins. He’ll talk about gifts, but if you follow him, he’ll make an ogre and two Uruk-Hai attack us. If you do not chase him but you shoot an arrow will deliver us a swordfish that will be called precisely Xiphiidae but in the Xbox version we will not find it in the clash of Aragorn against the Nazgul. In the PC version, yes. 

Could you give me some information? Remember other quirks or easter Eggs?"

lordoftherings,Melkor is a tragic figure,"I know he is ""The root of all evil"" but Illuvatar himself states that nothing can come into existence nor any new verse formed that does not have it's base in him. This means that Illuvatar essentially gave Melkor all this power, and all these tools and all this desire to create and then told Melkor that he can not create freely, and will not be allowed to do so.

Then finally after millennia Melkor get's trapped in the void for countless ages, all to search fruitlessly for the secret fire of creation to be able to create something from something.

Sure, Melkor created all things evil in the world, but imagine the torture, of being given all of these gifts, and then being told you basically can't use them."

Sam also carried the ring but only a short while. And yet, that was still long enough for him to be given the privilege of also being sailed into the Undying Lands. So that begs the question: for how long must you be a ring bearer before you technically become qualified to visit? Like, would Boromir who held the ring (at least in the movies, I don't know if that also happened in the books) have been allowed access for having picked up the ring at the top of Caradhras (I think)?

lordoftherings,LoTR overrated?,"Hi friends,

I recently read the Lord of The rings book. Before this fantasy book, I have read some Fantasy series like ASOIAF, Wheel of Time, Kingkiller Chronicles.
The things is, I don't enjoy LoTR not as half as these series. For me, it felt like the character arcs is not as great as the series I mentioned above. Also the first half of LoTR felt like a gang walking in a fantasy world meeting strangers. Which bored me. 
I knew many people fell the same way. 
I think many people who likes the series more than ASOIAF are the one who read LoTR during 80s or 90s when they are not many fantasy books. I might be wrong here. 

Also what's the deal with The One Ring? I know earlier Sauron used it to control persons wearing the other rings before his fall, thus manipulating them to do biddings for him. But now most of all those rings are destroyed. Either burnt by a dragon or destroyed some otherway. With only a ring or two left what power does One Ring has anymore? It seems like the only power it was left is to make the wearer invisible. But it's power is diminished why bother taking all those efforts to destroy it?

One of my friend is defending LoTR by saying the movie is good. But I didn't watch it. But I know nothing much is explained about the One Ring there.

Please help me understand this. Is it really necessary to suffer all those things and not to mention war to destroy a ring which can't do nothing much than making you invisible?"

lordoftherings,What is something you felt Peter Jackson actually improved upon or added that was better then in the books?,"For me it is that Thédred gets more relevance, in the book i always got this weird dismissive feeling about his death from Théoden. As he is leaving for battle he just mentions Eomer is his successor as “I have no child, Théodred my son is slain.” And thats it no other mentions to his  only child being killed while he was under Saurmans influence. In the movie we get this beautiful and sorrowful funeral with Eowyn’s beautiful lament for her cousin in Rohirric and Théoden grieving for his child with Benard Hill’s amazing acting and most painful quote of “No parent should have to bury their child” It was one of my favorite scenes for what it evoked."

But we really don't see him do much fighting. He got beat by saruman pretty easily. He says that if he put on the ring he would be more dangerous than sauron, does this mean he is already stronger than him without the ring. He was obviously stronger after becoming gandalf the white but just how much stronger. He was still beat by the witch King if I recall. The strongest I've seen him is when he thought the balrog. Iv only ever seen the films, I have to book but I can't be bothered to read them. Can someone tell me how strong gandalf really is?"

I'm writing a BA thesis about ***""How religious beliefs of authors impact and reflect in their works""*** based on Narnia and LOTR. .   
In this case it's J.R.R. Tolkien's LOTR and christianity. I would mostly prefer to focus on the first book, but others are fine as well.

However, I'm struggling to return to start reading the appendices of the last book. They're 60-70 pages long, I think. For those who've read 'The Hobbit' and the LOTR book series, you all know how tedious reading these books could be. I could imagine how much more tedious the appendices would be, especially with all the lores, genealogies, and footnotes! Haha

I'd just like to know your thoughts. Thank you! 😘"

lordoftherings,First Time Reading “Lord of the Rings”,"I’ve read “The Hobbit” several times since I was a kid, and my last re-read was a few months ago. It’s been a long time coming for me to finally start “Lord of the Rings”. 
(I’ve also watched both “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” films many times in the past as well. I love both trilogies.)
I love “The Hobbit” and and I want to take a deep dive into “The Lord of the Rings” - really get invested in the lore and history of Middle Earth.
But, before I start, I have a few questions?

I know many say to read “The Hobbit” first - which I have - but is there anything more I should read or be made aware of before starting “The Lord of the Rings”?

Should I read the Appendixes before, during, or after reading the “The Lord of the Rings”?

Would it be a good idea to learn some Sindarin beforehand, or any of the other languages? 

I am most grateful for any information and advice for reading “The Lord of the Rings”.

lordoftherings,Language Question,"I am getting a tattoo this week, and I am hoping to incorporate a saying in Khuzdul (or a similar tune based language) from Lord of the Rings. The translation is confusing me, as some of the symbols are based on multiple letters. I am hoping to get “Never Cursed” in Khuzdul. Does anyone have any advice or tips on how best to go about this? Thanks"
lordoftherings,Do you think this would have been something that Tolkein would have written had he gone into more detail in this field?,"In the fan film *Born of Hope*, which is about Aragorn's parents and birth, Dunedain rangers are portrayed as  having both men and women in their ranks. From what I've read, this has caused controversy among Tolkein purists who doubt that's how  Tolkein would have written them, and indeed there are a large number of blanks in areas of the lore of Arda.

Me personally, I think it's POSSIBLE that in the books, some of the rangers were women. After all, when you are a nomadic people, and supplies and manpower are limited, everyone has to contribute something. The Rangers had none of the luxuries their predecessors had, and beggars can't be choosers. So I would not be surprised if the rangers raised all their children in the art of survival, hunting, gathering, combat if they need to fight, or anything that can help the clan out. The more people who can pitch in, the better. And when you need everyone pitching in, gender roles often need to be shown the door.

I suppose this was also an early warning about all the reactionary reactions to Amazon's show."

lordoftherings,Shadow of Mordor/War canon (late to this discussion),"Okay, I’m quite familiar with Tolkien’s established lore and I’m NOT going to disagree with anyone and claim the shadow games fit within Tolkien’s book world because it just doesn’t. 
However, I am quite comfortable with these games being part of my head canon as backstory for Jackson’s films.

Jackson changes a lot, and I don’t disagree with his changes. I actually was introduced to the world through his films and read the novels and silmarilian after the fact. They’re two different canons.

I don’t think shadow of Mordor/War really alters much of Jackson’s movie canon. 

We see in the hobbit that Sauron hasn’t completely re-established himself and that many of the Orcs are operating independently. He’s literally trying to regain power in that film trilogy in the background and his threat is a looming presence that Gandalf and Galadriel are becoming aware of.

This slides perfectly into shadow of War/Mordor with the events of those games.

We don’t have as much backstory to the Nazgul in the films the way we do in  books and the concept of death and afterlife for men is only vaguely hinted at. We actually know that men can stay behind after death according to Jackson’s trilogy with the army of the dead, granted they’re numenoreans but still a section of men regardless. 

Shelob is the only questionable mention however I don’t mind the change, I’ve ran out of energy to argue this point 

TL;DR, I think you can head canon that the shadow games are film canon, as the film canon is quite vague and leaves room for events like the Shadow games.

lordoftherings,What makes the Children of Illuvater special?,"I was listening to the Silmarillion audiobook when I thought of the question that has always troubled me about the Tolkien universe. What makes the children of Illuvater, Elves, and Men, (and Dwarves adopted from Aule) distinct from all the talking animals and plants that populate middle-earth? It can't be simply sentience or sapience because things like trolls, Ents, Eagles, and Dragons can talk, and have personalities, and opinions. I've seen discussions that the talking animals like the various birds and wolves in The Hobbit, the fox in Fellowship, and Huan the hound are actually Maia, but there's no indication. The only ones I can believe are the Eagles since it's told they are the messengers of Manwe, so it can be guessed they're just Maia hanging around Middle-Earth gathering news, being literal Deus ex machinas, and Huan, since he is from Valinor, under Orome. My theory is what makes the children of Illuvater special is a lack of thralldom to a Vala. All the plants and animals may be self-aware and intelligent, but perhaps they are just extensions of Yavana, with no true free will, since Yavana can override them and command them. There's not a lot of evidence for this, but in Morgoth's case, he created dragons and trolls seemingly out of nothing, though he had to corrupt elves into orcs. Morgoth controls these creatures for his war, but they have no free will to disobey him, we never hear of a good dragon or troll. Smaug and the three trolls from the Hobbit are doing their own thing because Morgoth is chained so they're sort of on auto-pilot. So, what makes the Children special is they are beholden to no one, they can rebel and disobey anyone. The Noldor and Avari and Men can disobey the Valar at will and must be persuaded or brainwashed by Morgoth or Sauron to obey them, though the rings make things run faster for Sauron.

Are any of these ideas original? I've only read the Silmarillion, the trilogy, and The Hobbit on audiobook so I might not know some obscure lore."

But it is still very beautiful, featuring probably the best world building in any game of the genre, and great writing. Specially for fans of Tolkien’s works. I remember wondering in the depths of Moria, clearing some caves Goblins called home, when unexpectedly I ran into a wall full of cave art. Suddenly I realized the paintings depicted the event where the dwarves were driven out of Moria by the Balrog… from the goblins point of view. The game is filled witch such nice lore touches, and IMO is the best interpretation of Tolkien’s work outside of the books themselves. I recommend you give it a try!"

He smiled then, thinking 'well at least I'm not lost in time.' In the root hollow of a great oak, Bilbo huddled in his cloak and passed the rest of the night, comforted by the fresh air and the fat jam sandwich he drew from a pocket. It was the most marvelous bivouac snack of his early wanderings.""

lordoftherings,Memoirs of Dol Amroth,"**So, a few months ago I was playing Third Age Total War and decided to write down some ""life accounts"" of characters and events taking place in Middle Earth. I posted it on a separate subreddit, but I thought people might enjoy it here.**

*Prince Adrahil - Summer 2980 of the Third Age*

I am very afraid. Afraid for my people, for the race of men, for the evils that lurk in the shadows. The shadows that crawl forward and encroach upon the River of Gilrain and the lands of Belfalas, edging ever closer towards The White City. Towards Gondor.

Gondor. Our ever faithful ally sits upon the precipice of oblivion, and I fear that they do not even realize it. Their Empire has become stretched and thin. Denethor’s paranoia has made him a shell of the man I once met in Linhir. Our Coastal Wardens are busy defending the straits, into Linhir and the rest of our lands, but how much can we ask of them. Our defences there have been shored up and occupied, for I fear if it falls, there will be nothing to stop the advance of the enemy into Dol Amroth itself.

Our enemies are numerous. The Variags of Khand to the east and the tribes of the Haradrim to the south pose our most immediate threats. Nomads all of them with a disdain for the lives of Dol Amrothians. It is they who send their warriors to our shores, probing our defences. The men of Umbar patrol in their ships on our western shores. We see their lights, at night, illuminated against the waters. Waiting. The strange people of the Ar-Adûnâim still remain a mystery to me, but I shall keep a close eye upon the choices they make, and the side they choose.

Yet these enemies pale in comparison to the armies of Mordor and the forces of The Dark Lord Sauron. I am no wizard. I do not claim to have the powers of the Istar, and yet I have felt his presence. Being renewed and growing stronger with each passing day. I feel in my chest the forces of darkness stirring once more. Does Denethor feel it too? Is this why his mind has been so troubled, as of late?

If the realm turns to Men to slow the coming tide of evil, who can we turn to? Where are the Istar to help us face this darkness? Where have all the Maiar gone? And the Valar? What can we mortals do when the end of the world appears in view.

*Baragund - Winter 2980 of the Third Age*

We are the watchers of the door. The lighthouse in the night. The wardens of the Sea. We will protect our beauty from all those that would see her harmed. Forty years my family has been the keepers of Gobel Tolfalas and for Forty years she has stood tall, proud, and free. Last evening three ships of Ar-Adûnâim sailed into our port and had the audacity to place the port city under siege. I watched from my tower as our ships met them. How they beat them back into sea, fleeing like a whipped dog. They hope to catch us asleep at the helm. They are much mistaken. While I am tasked with safeguarding the realm I shall stand vigilant and attentive of the sea. My enemies dare to try to take this island. They shall be met with spear, shield, sword, and fury.

*Mistven - Winter 2980 of the Third Age*

My father in law, the Prince, asks Edhellond of me. The great elven city that sits upon our western shores has long been a desire of his, and for our people. I am excited for this opportunity. May it be the start of glorious redemption from our past inactivity.

Istion - Spring 2981

Three weeks since leaving Linhir. I have been tasked with dealing with a group of local bandits. I have taken Legio II and placed them under my command. We rode out...scouted them to the shores of the Anduin, and met them upon the battlefield. We were outnumbered 2 to 1 with the bulk of our forces being cavalry. Some of Lenhir’s own Coastal Wardens joined our ranks. I respect the Order and what it stands for. These Coastal Wardens are truly saltwater born and they can fight under my banner any day.

On the battlefield our cavalry made short work of their archers. Our wardens held the enemies attention and rained their javelins down upon them. We followed them further south and beat them on the straits ofAnduin and again defeated them handily. Now there are rumblings of more Adunaim rebels, south of the river. My and Legio II’s work is not yet done. My mission takes me across The Anduin, closer to enemy territory and the Haradrim and Ar-Adunaim. Our scouts shall be working long hours for the coming campaign.

*Mistven - Spring 2981 of the Third Age*

I have been placed under the command of another of Adrahil’s sons, Aravorn. The man is a bore and timid for a top. I have no inclination to listen to the orders of someone who is weak willed. While marching towards Edhellond I asked him what his plan was to take the city. He replied that he would take as long as needed to capture it, and when we arrived he placed the city under siege and we haven’t moved since. He has no hope to become a great general if he cannot trust his soldiers to bring him victory. I hope that the Umbar soldiers sally out, otherwise I fear we will be sitting on our hands for some time.

*Istion - Autumn 2981 of the Third Age*

Across the Straits of the Anduin we have found nothing but enemies. More rebels, more fighting. My men have performed admirably and my full faith is with them. The cavalry of Legio II continues to make an impact. I owe them all high honours upon our return to Linhir, and perhaps a round or two of ale. Yet, the march continues. There is news, from travelers on the road, of towns taken over by brigands. Something to make mind of. If Amroth should be the protector of the people, then I must uphold the Prince’s protection, to all who need it. We will make the Prince proud, or die trying.

Mistven - Summer 2982 of the Third Age

It has been over a year since we placed Edhellond under siege. The days drag like mud sliding down an ale barrel ramp. I take back everything I said about him being a poor general. He is a coward who would rather toil in his books and ledgers than lift a sword. The men have no respect for him and constantly question his leadership.

*Aravorn - Spring 2983 of the Third Age*

The enemy sallies out to meet us. I had hoped to avoid bloodshed, nevertheless we are called to act. I am grateful that we have been sent some Haven Guards. They truly are an impressive sight. I believe only those from the Order of The Silver Swan would dare meet them on the battlefield. May Amrothian courage hold fast on this day.

*Unknown Coastal Warden in Legio II - Spring 2983 of the Third Age*

We met upon the battlefield, near the base of Edhellond. Today would have been my first battle. My regiment was made up of men from my village. We were eager, if not a tad worried. I stood only a handful of paces from Commander Aravorn. Steely eyed determination sat behind his eyes. He had a confident look about him. Our army watched them waiting for a move, but none came. We must have sat for over an hour before a rider was sent into no-mans land. Upon the return of our own rider Commander Aravorn said that the day was ours. The enemy had surrendered without a fight. We were told not to harm a hair on the enemies head, and to let them go. I made eye contact with a bloke coming out of the keep. He looked half starved, which he probably was. They snaked their way north along the coast, to where? I haven’t the foggiest idea. Never saw them again though, probably made homes in some small Gondorian town somewhere. A failed invasion by invaders who never stayed, yet never left either.

Mistven - Spring 2983 of the Third Age

Nearly three years of sitting and waiting. Sieging and staying. Scanning and watching. To see a battle that never took place."

If you want you can dm me a foto of the book, it'll be easier.

but in the intro for the return of the king when smeagol and deagol are fishing, it's Deagol who picks it up from the bottom of the lake when he is being dragged forward by the fish.

Did he use his powers to materialise it straight out of the lava? Was it a pre-existing ring that he tainted with dark magic whilst inside Mount Doom? Was there literally a forge on the walkway that was fueled by the lava?

This also leads me to the question of how did Elrond know how/where to destroy it after Isildur first defeated Sauron?"

lordoftherings,The inversion of the Entmoot was perhaps the most unforgiveable liberty taken by New Line Cinema / Wingnut studios.,"Look, we all agree that the films were imperfect, and maybe that filming The Lord of The Rings was itself a mistake. But the one aspect that still bugs me to this day is them turning the Ents and the Entmoot on their heads. 
I’m ploughing through reading the books to my son and partner, complete with carefully differentiated voices and sometimes even one-man stageshows. Right now we’re in Fangorn, and I’m reminded that Treebeard was already aware of the “wastes of stumps” left by Saruman’s depredations. But just a few pages before, he preshadows the rousing determination shown by the Ents, when he carefully points out that the Ents are more like Men in that they are “more changeable that the Elves are, and quicker at taking the colour of the outside…”
It ticks me off because I hold that the Entmoot was a metaphor carefully crafted by Tolkein to show that even a deeply conservative, extremely long-term-thinking people working within a slow process to gain unanimity and and solidarity, can flare into deadly action on the basis of collegiate thinking soley. The point in the film where Treebeard howls like Stanley Kowalski upon stumbling on some stumps and junks his community’s resolution on the basis of an emotional reaction makes me groan to this day. 
That’s what I think."

While advancing scene after scene and almost tearing up like a maiden at the big battles and the sacrifices scenes i had to keep track of all the jewelry going around in the lore. I understood then and there that even if it’s powerless in nature , the ring of barahir is the most important jewel of the story , above the one ring that he precedes and ultimately outlasts. The ring in question was offered to Barahir after he saved a Noldor king. Went to Beren, who was basically giga chad, then elros the first king of Numenor and brother to Elrond, then Elendil founder of Gondor and Arnor and finally Aragorn! So the ring across the ages has always been at the finger of the greatest adversaries of evil, almost like it had a will of its own. Until finally it won , being the only ring of renown remaining after the fall of Sauron and the elves leaving middle earth with the Three. Ô sacred sub please spread the love of the ring of Barahir!"

lordoftherings,Best simple explanations to the big mysteries.,"What are your favourite simple or mundane answers to big Lord of the Rings mysteries? Can include any Arda expanded universe stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance the **Entwives' disappearance**. It was a huge mystery that I couldn't begin to understand as a kid. But it makes a lot more sense reading it after having adult relationships. After being dumped by women for quite sensible reasons, I think I get it. The ""**they just got fed with of talking to ents**"" theory makes sense.

 Treebeard spends hours and hours trying to talk to all the other ents about how a couple of people who don't look or act remotely like orcs are orcs. Without remotely keeping them informed of how its going. They should be dealing with a national emergency! Then Treebeard ponders why his wife left them in the exact same chapter?  I want a divorce from these mossy old geezers and I'm just reading them in a book.

Can you imagine an entire lifetime of planning dates with Treebeard? How the hell the entwives got past the honeymoon period is beyond me. Also, wouldn't it be easier to just go? Rather than going through centuries-long marriage counselling sessions?"

Yet when the Lamps are destroyed and later the elves awaken they know nothing but the darkness save the light stars and the Elves come to love (for lack of a better word) the darkness. The way that I would understand it seeing that the Value go on to create new light in the form of the two trees Melkor seems to be a sort of bringer of darkness.
So how is it that the Moriquendi still prefer the darkness to the light if it seems to be an “aspect” of Melkor.
Is it part of their corruption trough him or does it have other reasons?"

I've always been a fan of the movies, and I've finally decided to get into the books/other LOTR media, since I'm not too jazzed about the upcoming Amazon series. I really want to start with an audiobook version, but there's at least two popular unabridged audiobooks I've been able to find access to performed by Rob Inglis and Andy Serkis respectively. I also stumbled across the 1981 BBC Radio dramatization. With so many options, I can't decide which to begin with! I know the radio dramatization is an adaptation, not an audiobook, but it seems to have been very well done and popular - and I love that Ian Holm plays Frodo and was later cast as Bilbo in the films.  

Eventually, I'll likely get to both the dramatization and at least one of the audiobook versions, but I wanted to pose the question here: does anyone have any strong opinions as to which audio experience is the best?"

lordoftherings,[The Hobbit-film] Why was Gandalf not concerned about Bilbo having the ring?,"Towards the end of the Hobbit: Battle of 5 armies, Gandalf warns Bilbo that magic rings are not to be used lightly, and then tells him he’s know he’s had it since they left the Goblin caves.

But why didn’t he take it from him? Did he not know it was the ring of power? It would’ve been way easier to destroy the ring back then since Sauron’s armies were depleted and he wasn’t anywhere near full power again.

On top of that, he knew the ring was still around somewhere because Elrond witnessed it not be destroyed during Sauron’s first coming, which Gandalf was also present for.

He also gives Bilbo a very stern cold look as he walks away, implying that he knows more about the ring than he’s led on. 

My only theory is that he figured Bilbo wouldn’t share it with anyone, and even if he did hobbits are too humble and pure of heart to care, so its kind of a perfect hiding spot. However, even that doesn’t make sense because Gollum still knew where it was and told the orcs anyways… can anyone explain this??"

lordoftherings,"Cautiously optimistic. Always hope for the best, always expect the worst","The new material showing the new series has divided a lot of people. Some people don't like the black dwarf Queen, some people love it. A lot of people feel like the assumed nudity, which I don't know if that's true or not, goes against what JRR Tolkien's personal beliefs were, therefore goes against what the Lord of the Rings is. Honestly the best way to gauge whether you think you'll like the series or not, is to look at a lot of recent shows and movies from the past couple years. If you like the stuff that's been coming out lately, more than likely you'll like the show. If you think what Hollywood and streaming services have been putting out lately seems rushed, contrived, and just purely made for a cash in, more than likely you won't like the show. But let's look at Amazon specifically. I have not watched The Boys, or Invincible. But I've heard a lot of great things. Facts are facts I have a family, and my wife has not been interested, therefore I have not been interested by proxy. Honestly I'm dying to watch these shows. Those are Amazon originals. I don't know how involved Bezos is with his streaming service, but I know they offer a much bigger selection than Netflix. I watch prime more than I watch any other service I pay for. I refuse to pay for Disney plus I don't care what anyone says. Maybe it will be good. I'm going into it hoping to God that it is good. But honestly, I'm just expecting more of the same. Greedy studio heads trying to cash in on loyal fan bases. I feel like they're just going to turn around and put out the quickest shit they can. Forced diversity and have token characters and not give a damn about actual diversity. But just like the Witcher, I'm going to give it a chance. I gave The Witcher a chance because I like Henry Cavill. And he did not disappoint. I don't know the lady's name who plays Yennifer, but she does really well. The young lady who plays Cirilla does really well. The acting in that show is some of the best I've seen in years. But the stories just suck. I really hope that the Lord of the Rings series just blows everyone away. I have a lot of respect for Tolkien. Especially after reading about his experience in the Great war. You can definitely see the influence that had on his later works. I just hope Amazon doesn't screw the pooch on this one and actually delivers something solid. Let's all be cautiously optimistic. God bless you all and keep you."

lordoftherings,I just finished reading the Hobbit and I’m a quarter of the way through the first Hobbit movie and I have a few questions.,"First of all thank you for answering my questions if anyone does. I finally decided it was time for me to hop into the LOTR story and I started with the Hobbit.

Q1: can somebody explain the chestnut riddle to me? 

Q2: I read the first edition, I did not realize there was a newer one. Am I missing out? And should I buy the second edition and reread it before continuing much further?

Q3: am I wrong in thinking that Thorin is much too serious in the movie, and much too good looking? Idk I imagined him a lot more.. goofy, for lack of a better term, and also I imagined him much thicker lol.

Q4: are there other novels that are LOTR canon that I can buy that are worth throwing into the batch of books that I will be reading for a while now

Q5: is Radagast the Brown mentioned later in the books? Or did I somehow miss him in my first read

It’s an awesome book by the way. I’m going to be hooked on LOTR content for a few months now for sure."

lordoftherings,Thesis Proposal,"Hey guys, for my mythology project, we get to talk about any piece of fiction and argue a point.

&amp;#x200B;

For my thesis, I will be arguing that:

In the Lord of the Rings, the main character Frodo Baggins is portrayed as the hero of the story, with Aragorn becoming the king. Both are heroes in their own perspectives but what defines a person to be a hero?

In order to define this, I will be using Joseph Campbell’s 12 step journey for someone to consider themselves to be a hero. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Ordinary World

Call to adventure

Refusal of the call

Meeting the mentor

Crossing the threshold

Tests, allies, enemies

Approach to the innermost cave

The ordeal

The hero overcame the greatest fear and challenge to earn the reward

The road back

The resurrection

Return with the elixir

In the Fellowship, there are 9 core members: Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas, and Gimli. I will dive deep into analysis on Frodo, and Samwise, and explain why **Samwise Gamgee is the best fit for the Hero Cycle and not Frodo.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I will talk about how Frodo doesn't fit this because of the fact that he doesn't complete the hero cycle at the end with the ""Return with the elixir"" with Frodo not settling down but Sam settles down and he gets married, fulfilling the duty of the hero cycle

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: The reason why I am writing to you all is I need help coming up with more ideas and elaborating about Sam (any details that I may be missing that would help) and I also want to explain how Aragorn doesn't really fit with it either with his awkward entrance and the reader not getting a clear introduction at first. Do you have any suggestions as to what I can add and what I can say? Thank you very much (and I apologize for such a lengthy post)"

if the show is bad it does not change the original story at all. we will always have the books/movies. if this new thing is bad and you don’t like it, you never have to watch it again. if it’s cool. then we have another great piece of art to enjoy and bring us in to middle earth.

I feel if they would have filmed that section, it wouldn’t have come across correctly and people would have interpreted it wrong that “Frodo is weak, a whimp, blah blah”"

I think it's a fairly flawed piece of art, but there are still some cool things about it! So I thought that we could play a little game: let's try to say something nice about this weird, weird adaptation. I want to keep it pretty positive, so if you want to lob a criticism about the movie, try to say **two positive things** about it first.

* \+ I really loved how they depicted the wraith-world in this movie; it's not as iconic as the Peter Jackson interpretation, but I thought it was interesting and cool.
* \+ There's a shot at Weathertop that tries to do the circular Avengers camera about 30 years earlier!
* \- The whole movie feels fairly unepic, but the biggest disappointment for me was how ""unmagical"" magic was.

On my shelf there are two copies of The Lord of the Rings. One is a complete edition with all the parts in a single book. The other is divided into three books (Fellowship, Towers, King).  

This made me wonder, do people see The Lord of the Rings as a series or a single book that was published in pieces for practical reasons (i.e. The Count de Monte Cristo)?

Which version of the book(s) were you exposed to first? Do you think that affected your opinion?

And maybe this is addressed in the books and my dumbass just forgot about it since I read them over a very spread out time period, but why would Arwen be stuck in Middle Earth hypothetically after Aragorn’s death? Would she not be able to sail west afterwards? Is this just Elrond being an overprotective father? What’s the deal here? 
Again, sorry if this addressed somewhere, I don’t have the best grasp on the all LOTR lore right now. It normally takes me a few reads to really pick up on everything in fantasy series. Thank you!!"
