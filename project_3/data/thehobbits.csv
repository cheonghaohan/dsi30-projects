TheHobbit,Tolkien taught us Physics,"5am thoughts brought to you by Tolkien loving insomniac edition 6,722

Realistically our entire theory of our universe has moved (through string theory) into essentially an understanding/hypothesizing that our entire universe follows the principles of music 

Essentially the mind of the creator is the music of the universe 

Now WHO do we know that literally wrote an entire mythos based off the ideology that the music of the creator was the literal embodiment of the physical universe of the mythos?

Tolkien was a gift to humanity and was so far ahead of his time he essentially postulated string theory and presented it to society (in a way that laymen could actually fathom) well before we could prove any of it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

Outside of that I'm looking for ideas of smaller elements to incorporate into my arm sleeve. For example an acorn, JRR's initials, Smaug above the mountain, Sting, elvish, etc! I've just started putting this together and I'd be happy to hear any and all recommendations! 

For reference, this would be on my right arm. It'll be full color and several sessions. Nothing is out of the question! :)"

TheHobbit,The Hobbit Being Adapted Over 3 Movies instead of 1 Didn't Hurt it as Much as how that extra time was used.,"Disclaimer: For any direct references to the book, I am relying mostly on memory and a quick google search to confirm, feel free to correct me in the comments if I make an incorrect claim about something that was or wasn't included in the source material. 

I recently rewatched Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies and while, yes, The Hobbit movies were of substantially lower quality than the LOTR movies, I found myself unbothered by the idea of stretching the comparatively shorter source material over 3 movies. This stretching a roughly 300 page book into 8 hours of film (compared to each individual book in the LOTR trilogy being substantially longer and getting 3.5-4 hours of film in each of their extended editions) is a common criticism I have seen in my admittedly limited exploration into thoughts/reviews of the movies, however I believe that the increased length was not as much an issue compared to how that extra screen time was used.

One of the major additions that I thought enhanced the films was the expansion of the plotline with Sauron as the necromancer in Dol Guldur. In the book Gandalf says he originally acquired the key to Erebor from Thrain who was being held captive by a ‚ÄúNecromancer‚Äù in Dol Guldur, and is not mentioned much after that. In the films there is a whole plot line throughout the last 2 movies with Gandalf and the other members of The White Council investigating and combating the threat of Sauron at Dol Guldur which is not included in the original book. (Although I do think these events were written about by Tolkien retroactively) I thought this plotline's inclusion actually benefited the films, it helps contribute to the story in the LOTR movies more directly and helps flesh out Tolkien's vast world for those only familiar with the movies even more.

Unfortunately a lot of the additions in the Hobbit movies only end up being dramatic spectacle that don‚Äôt serve strong narrative purposes (for example, the barrel scene in The Desolation of Smaug being much more drawn out compared to its equivalent text.) If instead, more of the extra screen time these films got was spent on subplots that deviated from the source material,  but add to and expand Tolkien's incredible and massive world to those unfamiliar with the source material, I believe that these movies would be viewed much more favorably. Unfortunately most of the added content in these movies is mere eye-candy."

It was a simple game, build a city, grow an army and pvp to level up. Rewarding and fun, but that's not why people flocked to it. What they went for was the Global Chat, a Giant entry point for anyone who was on the game at the same time. This was 9 years ago. The game has well and truly shut down at this point. 

To get to my point, my user name on this game was TheLoneWolfTLW. I remember that I was on a Thorin server. I am hoping to reconnect to my closest friend on that server - a user called Slavegirl. 

I know this one is a long shot, but it's been nearly a decade and I still think about them sometimes.
So, if by some miracle, the user who used to be Slavegirl, you find this, I'd love to reconnect.

If you search up ‚ÄúAdagio‚Äù by Brian Tyler, you should really hear what I‚Äôm talking about. Jump to 0.29 seconds or so. 

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs normal for soundtracks to sound similar, as there are so many movies and TV shows out these days, but I‚Äôm still baffled for some reason. Maybe this is a common sound often sampled for film?"

In the last few days, I get some fears and thoughts about my transition that make me doubt my own motivation.
Like Bilbo Baggins I have (for now) a static life yet very easy and steady which I really enjoy and sometimes I wonder why the hell I even want this transition when I have everything here?

I read the Hobbit book and I am a quarter of the way through the first movie.

Q1: can somebody explain the chestnut riddle to me? 

Q2: I read the first edition, I did not realize there was a newer one. Am I missing out? And should I buy the second edition and reread it before continuing much further?

Q3: am I wrong in thinking that Thorin is much too serious in the movie, and much too good looking? Idk I imagined him a lot more.. goofy, for lack of a better term, and also I imagined him much thicker lol.

Q4: are there other novels that are LOTR canon that I can buy that are worth throwing into the batch of books that I will be reading for a while now

I mostly focused on three topics form the book to analyze this : mentions and involvements of battle, comradeship vs friendship, and the implications of the narrator character. I just gave my presentation to the class before I turned my final paper in and it was received really well by my teacher I think. just thought id share with you all as its a very interesting analysis that I had to do that gave me a whole new perspective about the morals and characters of the book. very interesting. im down to answer questions or share the project to anyone who is interested."

**7. Why did Bilbo and Guglunk face each other?**

**8. What happened to Thorin at the end of the book? Tell me more about it.**

TheHobbit,Another Rant Defending The Hobbit Movies,"I‚Äôm an AVID defender of The Hobbit movies, with The Hobbit being my favorite book as well. I honestly think that the movies did a fantastic job of capturing the heart of the book. When you sit down and read the book, all the emotions you feel are replicated in the films. People are way too harsh on The Hobbit and always put LOTR on a pedestal. I love LOTR just as much as all of you, trust me I absolutely do. But face the facts. Both LOTR and The Hobbit faced major rewrites when transferred from book to film (Arwen saving Frodo, Scouring of the Shire, The Army of the Dead never even go to Minas Tirith in the book) LOTR may use more practical effects, but they were also using the most cutting edge technology of their time and a surprising amount of cgi wherever they could. The Hobbit happened to be made a couple of years later when technology was a little more advanced and they could use cgi more liberally. If they could‚Äôve done that for LOTR, they would‚Äôve. 

And honestly? The Hobbit movies are just fun. I never imagined a world where I‚Äôd see the song Goblin Town on screen but here it is."

TheHobbit,Is the white orc changed in 4K Extended?,I just watched The Hobbit 4K extended and I saw the white orc looks far less shiny and over all better than in the theatrical release. Is it just me or was he adjusted in this version?

Does anyone have any thoughts, or did Tolkien ever write about, why he chose to introduce the killer of Smaug so late? The company even visited Lake-town earlier in the book, and Bard could have been introduced then, it seems.

(I've only seen a couple of the movies and don't remember them, this is specifically about the book. Thanks!)"

TheHobbit,The Hobbit | Live Audiodrama | April 11 At 8 Pm EST / 5 PM PST- Hosted by r/LOTR_on_Prime,"&amp;#x200B;

[A live Audiodrama on r\/LOTR\_on\_Prime](https://preview.redd.it/sc1abhwxptr81.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86c23b24d1bc70af6985c1d9e94ea246e9501779)

# Hello folks!

On Monday, April 11, 2022 at 8 PM EST or 5 PM PST our subreddit r/LOTR_on_Prime is hosting a Live Audiodrama of The Hobbit. The company that will be voice acting this is called [Audiotorium](https://twitter.com/AUDIOTORIUMLIVE) and they are a Social Audio Production Studio.

# What is a Talk?

Reddit Talk is a new feature that is still currently in testing on Reddit where subreddits can host voice chat. Audiotorium previously hosted a Reddit Talk where they did a Halloween special. If you, or your subreddit is interested in applying for your subreddit to be approved to have Talk enabled you can find out more details on r/RedditTalk.

# What is the catch?

There is none, I promise. I am not here trying to swindle you fine folks into getting an extended warranty on your vehicle or have any personal gain. I simply want to do something that I believe is cool, drama free, and would show off the voice acting chops of the team while also showing off a new Reddit Feature.

# What do I have to do?

This part is simple. Just tune in when the event goes live. During the event you will be able to react to things with emojis and comment in the thread while its live. It is possible, once it is over, if you want to come up on the stage and talk to the team you can wave your hand ( its a button I promise ) and they can call you up to talk for a bit. Outside of that? Just listen to the experience and enjoy yourself. Its a child-friendly story and the cool part about a Talk is that if you are an audience member you can minimize your app if its the official reddit app and the audio will continue to play.

# Will we get a notification when this is live?

The way Talks work, to not spam the entirety of Reddit, you will only be notified that this event is live if you are subscribed to the r/LOTR_on_Prime subreddit. So what is my recommendation? Subscribe until the event goes live next week and then unsubscribe once its over if you do not wish to see discussions about the upcoming Rings of Power show. My feelings will not be hurt and I encourage it!

# What if I can't make it?

I completely understand that most of the world won't be able to make it live. One cool feature of the Talk is that is should record and be available later that night or the next day. Again, this feature is in testing and there could be hiccups.

# Have any other questions I didn't answer above?

Please drop a comment below and I will do my best to answer them.

I posted this with approval from the mods beforehand."

TheHobbit,Watching The Hobbit and‚Ä¶üòÉ,"Okay so I watched LOTR multiple times. Grew up watching it, probably my favorite trilogy, blah blah blah. I‚Äôve just watched The Battle of Five Armies having never really paid attention to any of The Hobbit movies before and I‚Äôve just found that there‚Äôs a lot of moments where I‚Äôm like ‚Äúhuh???‚Äù I‚Äôve found it to be overall just one big meh and at times I felt that I didn‚Äôt even know what I was watching because something just felt‚Ä¶off. I liked the fan service but obviously only because it reminded me of LOTR. No, I haven‚Äôt read the books and don‚Äôt plan to. So I guess my question is, am I missing something or is this just generally not a well-liked prequel? It just doesn‚Äôt feel cohesive and like it should have even been a prequel to begin withüò¨"
TheHobbit,Smaug,
TheHobbit,I‚Äôve just started the first LOTR movie,"I just finished all 3 of The Hobbit films. I started the first LOTR and am almost finished. Personally, The Hobbit was a much better experience for me, so far. No hate for LOTR or anything ( I know it could start getting better ) I just liked the ‚Äúadventure‚Äù aspect of The Hobbit and I really liked Bilbo. I just wanted to know what your guys opinions are on this topic. No spoilers please! This is my first time around with these films and I‚Äôm also considering purchasing The Hobbit books, do to the fact that in my experience books always blow the film out of the water.

I am black, I spent my childhood reading the books and watching the movies. I never question the fact there weren't black people. It was a European story, I absolutely adored it the way it was.

The thing I am most upset about, is I am a writer. I would be mortified if people took a dirty turd all over my work like this. People feeding off my story for their own political agenda.

This is filth.

In their ""pursuit of diversity"" they have done nothing but been completely racist.

It's a crime to history, to black people and to a great writer.

Please cancel it for the BETTERMENT of society. And to protect WRITERS!"

TheHobbit,"""What were they thinking"" errors in the Movies","I know the movies aren't the favorite things around here - but just looking at them as pure Entertainment value they are worth an occasional watch.

Some parts (and writing) is just so stupid though, it breaks the fun for me. I'm not talking about the Goblin race out of the Goblin halls (surely meant as silly, unrealistic, fun) or the slapstick barrel chase.  I mean more like ""What were they thinking"" sort of stuff.  

I'd love to have any examples you found pointed out.  I'm rather collecting them.

The one that REALLY gets me is when Thranduil offers Thorin a deal.  ""I will let you go if you return me the gems"".

Then Thorin proceeds to turn down the deal because he says he doesn't trust Thranduil to hold up his end of the bargain.  What?  What kind of stupidity is this.  The deal is:

1) Thranduil lets Thorin go (Thranduil's part of the bargain)

2) Thorin returns the gems (which Thorin can decide to do or not later)

How the heck could Thranduil NOT hold up his end of the bargain?  That's very importantly step #1 to facilitate step #2. Seriously the writers couldn't figure out something better than this?

Others (far more forgivable than above):

1) Bilbo can understand the Spiders even after he takes off the ring.  Just so the spider can name ""Sting"". WHY the heck would he take off the ring in a middle of a Spider fight?  To taunt them? Obviously stupid but surely seems like something Bilbo would not do.

2) Sauron calls Azog back to Dol Goldur and proceeds to tell him.... absolutely nothing. ""Our army is getting bigger. Everyone else will die"" ... that's about it. He needed to come home for that?

3) ~~Why didn the Eagl~~  There is no #3"

TheHobbit,The Hobbit Hatred,"As a person who loves both trilogies, it really bothers me when people desecrate The Hobbit or compare the two movies. Yes, they are connected in a sense. But the Hobbit is Bilbos adventure and LoTR is Frodos adventure. I guess, seeing a post in LoTR sub kinda just irked me. I feel like I have to defend The Hobbit. I‚Äôm aware I don‚Äôt. I understand not liking a movie, but to be an ass to someone else because they do enjoy it, just grinds my gears. Is it just me, or does anyone get insulted for liking The Hobbit?"
TheHobbit,What do we khow about Sauron?,"First off I assumed that Sauron was a bastardization of his real name so [looking at the elven languages](http://valianttheywere.blogspot.com/2022/02/linguistic-archaeology-history-of.html) I determined S occurs too late in language development chain, so it must be a shift from Ca-ur-on where each is a fragment of earlier elf/Eldar words. There are several that have Ca as a fragment, but ur is most likely d√ªr (dark) and elenion (star). These are both Quenya as opposed to Sindarin. You have in language development of the eldar the 'proto-Sindarin who break off and go their own way. This leaves the remaining eldar to ask a qustion about who they are. Without the Sindar, are they still Eldar? Their conclusion is they are the Quenya.

So if we assume Sa-ur-on's name is built from the suffix of three Quenya words. Anca (Jaws) is the other word. Sauron comes from Anca-d√ªr-elenion or Jaws Darkstar (a star so massive light cannot escape). 

The alternate quenya words are:

1. Carca (fang)

2. Calma (lamp) 

As the Ca is a prefix position it might be Calma (lamp)-d√ªr (Dark)-elenion (star). 'Dark-star' is a pretty cool name for a Quenya elf. Its either an awesome life choice or an indightment on his character by others."

TheHobbit,Thranduil and Smaug - Casting,"I recently rewatched the Hobbit trilogy and I feel it has to be said: Those movies would have been so much better had casting just swapped Lee Pace and Benedict Cumberbatch. Benadryl Cinderella would have pulled off being a royal elf so well, and Lee Pace's weird posturing and attempt at being threatening and ethereal would have suited a visceral greedy beast better than a graceful elf. Cumberbatch was wasted on a performance where you could neither see nor really hear him. Any voice actor could have played that role with equal or greater success. Attaching a big name was a publicity move, not a casting need.

Pace's interpretation of the elf king of Mirkwood was way out of line with the others. His attempt to be intimidating and sinister fell flat. Maybe part of that is because he was alone on a green scene trying to intimidate tennis ball. His body language just plain did not work for me.

But swap the two, and I am all on board. Reserved, haughty, regal, with cold menace simmering, Cucumberbuns is Thranduil. And Lee Pace's villainy tends more toward a direct threat- physically intimidating, serpentine, rogueish. He would have done better as the massive, violent, egotistical, unchecked Smaug.

That's all I got."

TheHobbit,One of the most profound things I've heard said in a film and it got me right in the feels.,"I rewatched the Hobbit series this week and I heard a line that really got to me. Please bare with me because I'm terrible with names, so to make it easier to read I'll use this short hand :-

Legolas =L
Legolas Dad = LD
FE = Female Elf

After we meet LD I'm like man I hate this Arrgoant prick, does he even like his own kid? FE is awesome she kicks ass and falls in love with a dwarf even though she was basically brought up to essentially hate them. So we get to the bit at the end of the battle of the 5 armies FE has already told LD that he does have love in him (I clapped at that bit ngl), he's at the fortress seeing all the death and he's looking for his son all worried, he has his moment with L, tells him his mother loved him more than anything in the world (started tearing up at this point)  and sends him off to find Aragorn (excuse the spelling if it's wrong) he walks further in and finds FE with a dead Kili Craddled in her arms and he actually looks sad for her. She says (I'm paraphrasing) ""I loved him and now he's gone, why does it hurt so much?"" He looks at her and gently says ""because it was real"". That line hit me harder than anything and I thought this is the only answer to why grief hurts so much. Its a simple thing to say but it couldn't be more true, love effects our lives deeper than any other emotion it sometimes hurts to have it but it hurts more to lose it. 

I've watched the Hobbit series a few times (am currently reading the book for the first time) and have seen the lotr films many times over the years and some of the lines hit you in the feels or really make you think, but this was the first time a line in a film has hit me so hard.

Thank you for reading my little thought.. what are some of your favorite lines from the series?"

TheHobbit,I have an idea for a new Tolkien book üìö original idea alertüí° pls do not stealüôÉ or I will sueü§ó,"The elves of Mirkwood, Rivendell, and Lorien all decide that they will gain power and wit if they eat Elanor flowers from the forest of Lorien. Little do they know, they are slowly being poisoned into madness. They all, as a whole, have a sudden urge to commit the genocide of the Hobbits. They ally themselves with the spiders of Mirkwood and march on the shire. Little do the elves know, the spiders are actually outcast hobbits who got bit by Shelob. These spiders thrive by eating the hobbits foot crystals that only form on the hobbits bare feet. The elves want to force the Hobbits to wear shoes and so the spiders turn on the elves and bite them. The elves fight back and kill off the spiders, but not before they all get bit. This starts a whole new mutent race of elf-spiders that can swing around on webs and use fire boosters to fly. They are all broken inside and need the Balrog to save them and bring them inner peace. Not a single Hobbit is barefoot under the reign of the elves know as the reign of blondes. One hobbit emerges from the horrible darkness. His name is Tussle the muscle. He seeks out the balrog and draws it back to the shire with his defendant charm. He seduces the Balrog so that he can save his people, but what he didn‚Äôt plan on was catching feelings‚Ä¶ and so a love story begins in the most unlikely of places. Tussle has to choose between his fellow hobbits and the fire of his desire. To cure the elves and send them back to once they came, he must force the balrog to sacrifice itself. But can Tussle do such a thing? Luckily, the high dwarves of rainbow falls spare him from the choice. They suck the spider poison out of the elves bellybuttons and restore them to their former uncursed state. Everyone celebrates and as and apology and reconciliation between the elves and hobbits, the elves tear of the hobbits shoes and through them in the air. 
Peace is restored.

As the title says, I‚Äôm looking for a Hobbit Fan edit because myself and friends are going to watch the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit as a binge in the coming weeks. I‚Äôve searched over other posts and seeing as there‚Äôs so many, I‚Äôll list some criteria as to make it easier for those who have seen the edits to discern what would be the best option for myself and friends.

- Heavily Preferred to be 1 film in length (length is less of a concern, but anything above 4.5 hours is too much)
- While I have seen LOTR, my friends have not, so beginner friendly would be great
- we would like the edits to be fairly seemless (I.e We don‚Äôt want jarring edits, or to minimize them would be awesome).
- obviously the fluff would be preferred to be left out

That‚Äôs about it!!! Thanks ahead of time to those willing to respond, your help is greatly appreciated."

TheHobbit,I just re-watched all 3 movies on my home cinema system and almost wept with sadness when they were over. Why don't they make more movies of this calibre?,"I watched some of the actors from the Hobbit in other TV series/films and they just didn't deliver their lines nearly as well. I guess this is down to the director. Also, Jackson's camera angles were superb. Literally every moment of the films was a joy and now I want to watch the director's cuts but am literally scared that I will get immersed in them so much I won't want to rejoin the normal world!

And then I watched Wheel of Time and WHAT a disappointment that was!"

Give the jewels to the elves, commit his share to the people of Dale. It wouldn't have helped with the dragon sickness maybe but it wouldn't have been a betrayal and it might of nudged some stubborn Dwarven minds that something needed to be done. Its also possible that giving Thorin the stone would have broken him out of it if it was heavily stated in the giving how now that he had it he could bring his people home, emphasizing his love for his people. I mean it couldn't have gone much worse so it wouldn't have hurt to try."

 I just bought the remastered LOTR blu ray set (don't have 4k yet) and was looking to get the extended hobbit trilogy. However I know they remastered and color timed the hobbit films for the 4k release and the new middle earth ultimate collection. My question is are the 1080p blu ray discs in that set the same as the 2016 extended editions or are they also the new transfers? I'm wondering if I should wait and see if they re-release them separately like they did LOTR or if I should buy the 2016 set.

Anyone have the set and know the answer? Thanks!"

TheHobbit,The Rebuild of the Five Edits!,"Life has been busy but a Quality Rebuild of [my Hobbit edit ](https://ifdb.fanedit.org/hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-edits-the/) is under way! 

It's a little more complicated than a simple ""Find and Replace"" of my source files, so that has taken some extra time to sort, but we're cooking with gas, as they say.

I'm also toying with making a few small changes, outside of the usual Extra frame here, sloppy fade there, etc:

- TM2YC cut Blunt the Knives really cleanly in his edit and I'm thinking about doing it in a similar manner.
- I've also considered reinstating most of the Mirkwood sequence. I trimmed it after some feedback, and received some more feedback suggesting to revert it, and I think i agree. I like the longer bit, it really let's the confusion set in.
- Reinstating Sauron's eye showing up right before they enter Mirkwood and cutting it from Bilbo's encounter with Smaug is probably a for-sure thing at this point. This will keep Sauron in the film but will lessen the relationship between him and the Ring.
- Once I'm satisfied with these changes, I'm going to start working on an Episode 4.5 that contains the full High Fells/Dol Guldur subplot for the people who want to know what Gandalf was up to in between Episodes 4 and 5! This may prove a challenge as I myself don't enjoy hardly any of that sequence, but I'll do what I can!

Literary Devices:

I. Personification‚ÄîPersonification refers to a literary device in which the author

endows inanimate objects with human qualities or actions. For example:

Boulders, too, at times came galloping down the mountain-sides,

let loose by midday sun upon the snow. . .

What is being personified?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Chapters II ‚Äì IV (cont.)

I. Foreshadowing‚ÄîForeshadowing refers to the clues an author provides to suggest

what will happen later in the story. What did the following passage foreshadow?

That, of course, is the dangerous part of caves: you don‚Äôt know

how far they go back, sometimes, or where a passage may lead

to, or what is waiting for you inside.

Art Connection:

Tolkien never described the appearance of the goblins. Use your imagination to draw a

goblin. Compare our imagined goblins with those of your classmates.

Writing Activity:

Use the device of personification to enhance a written description of a scene that is

familiar to you."

2. Is there any indication of the gold Smaug is protecting the same metal used to make the one ring?"
TheHobbit,Bilbo and Smaug,"So I'm rewatching The Desolation of Smaug, and I had a question. Did Bilbo wake Smaug by disturbing the pile of gold? Or was Smaug already awake? The last scene of An Unexpected Journey was Smaug's eye opening, so was he just sitting there till Bilbo showed up? Kinda a small detail but I found the possibility of Smaug destroying Laketown being Bilbo's fault directly interesting."

Gandalf and Bilbo are talking and Bilbo says he regrets not hitting Thorin over the head or something of the like. Then Bilbo leaves to retire to his cabin and sleep.

TheHobbit,What does Bifur say to Bilbo in the extended cut of An Unexpected Journey?,[removed]
TheHobbit,Thorin began to see Bilbo as an equal,"I've been rewatching the hobbit (extended) a couple of times now and something I noticed Is how Thorin grows much more affectionate towards Bilbo over the movies. In the desolation of Smaug, when Bilbo is missing Thorin looks concerned, he also relies on Bilbo to release them from Thranduil's Halls.

*Balin: ""A deal was our only hope""*

*Thorin: ""Not our only hope""*

Bilbo also vouched for Thorin In lake-town. 

In the battle of the five armies. Every dwarf Is told to search the golden halls for the Arkenstone, yet Bilbo remains by Thorin's side without any obligation. In the throne room, Thorin begins to question the loyalty of his kin, not Bilbo's, you can also see how Bilbo stands on equal ground by Thorin's side rather than next to Balin and Dwalin who stand 3 steps lower.

This may just be the movie, but Bilbo Is also the only one who can temporarily ease Thorin's disease as you saw from their conversation about Bilbo's share. In the armory, Thorin gives the mithril tunic to Bilbo rather than wearing It for himself, he also expresses that he's been betrayed, being open to bilbo about It means he trusts him fully. 

""*This Gold, Is* ***Ours***"" Despite Bilbo not directly being kin, and was only granted a ""share"" according to the contract.

I do believe Thorin would've asked Bilbo to remain by his side were the Dragon's sickness not at play and had he not died"

TheHobbit,"They Hobbit trilogy is great but interior to the original trilogy, and that's okay.","Just got done watching all three Hobbit movies with my wife and they were great! No, they didn't match the original, but that's not really an indictment of the films. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is arguably the greatest movie trilogy ever made, best fantasy movies ever made, and probably the best book to film adaptations ever made 

They were landshark films that changed the industry. They're still reference level for costumes, makeup, practical effects, set design, etc. The Hobbit films were never going to live up to that. But then again no other fantasy films can compete with LotR either. Hell very few non-fantasy movies can go toe to toe with LotR and not get embarrassed.

And considering the dogshit that's being made nowadays, im grateful that Peter Jackson provided the world with nearly 20 hours of fantastic adventure to get lost in and escape from the world. Hell, nobody is even trying to make great high fantasy movies. It's all gender swapped franchises or comic book films. Yuck.

Anyways, I think it's silly to shit on these movies because it's underserved. The Hobbit movies can be inferior to the OT but still great fun, they're not mutually exclusive."

TheHobbit,One can dream of a remake...

But after watching Staged and Michael Sheen's comment (surely just a joke) about Martin stealing the role from him, it made me picture him as Bilbo, maybe in a mini series or something that could really portray the story as it should be. So now I'm trying to manifest that into existence because let's be honest, Sheen would be a GREAT Bilbo Baggins, he even has the curls for it. 

If anyone here has the money to make it happen, you know what you have to do. It would be considered humanitarian aid, I'm sure."

TheHobbit,Gandalf in Books vs Movie,"From what I‚Äôve gathered, Gandalf has a conversation with the dwarves that at some point prior to the adventure, he goes on a fact-finding mission and learns of Sauron (The Necromancer). In the movies, we don‚Äôt see this (as far as I know) happening before the adventure. 

That said, I also know that the movies ‚â† the books in terms of timeline and details. Is it absurd to think that this fact-finding mission is what we see take place in Desolation of Smaug, and they rearranged the placement of those events as a way to help explain Gandalf‚Äôs lack of participation in the books between Mirkwood and The Battle? Or is that explained in the book/movies separately and I just missed it?"

I've looked off and on for years to find the music used on The Hobbit records that are performed by actor Nicol Williamson. The opening is this song by Bob Stewart: [https://youtu.be/gyUM6RXYUwI](https://youtu.be/gyUM6RXYUwI)

The other music tracks on the Williamson recordings are not from this record, but most likely from the same publisher, Argo, and from around the mid 70s.

There must be someone out there who has come upon a track list, or was maybe even involved in the making of this record set - I would love to be able to create a music soundtrack of this amazing piece of my childhood."

TheHobbit,"""The Hobbit"" Timeline","Okay, I just finished watching the Hobbit film trilogy again and I can't shake something said near the end of the movie. When they're auctioning Bilbo's things, they say they assumed him dead as he's been gone for 30 months+. The Hobbit calendar is basically on par with our human one, with months having 30 days more or less and the entire year being 365 days, so this means that the events of The Hobbit took place over 2 1/2 years. This honestly doesn't make sense to me at all, but I haven't read the book, so that could be why I'm missing information. The story to me feels like it takes place over 3-5 months, max. Was this just a movie mistake or is the story's timeline actually that long? And if it is that long, could you explain where all that time comes from?"

My biggest gripe was the behaviour of the dwarves at Bilbo's house and Rivendell, they were loutish and slobby (banging heads, mead sloshing all over their beards, throwing food around, slobbering, ""UP HIS JACKSEY"", burning the elves furniture) and it was just so gross to watch, just played for cheap laughs to make them seem like stupid slobby characters and doesn't really fit in with their characters the rest of the film/s. Is there any edit where the worst of their behaviour is cut? There's plenty of footage of them having a rowdy time without the really slobby loutish bits"

TheHobbit,"If you were making a movie of The Hobbit that captures everything from the book (same league of accuracy as the LOTR films), how long would it be?","Not geared at criticizing the movies, am just genuinely curious. My opinion:

&gt;!I think to capture the book, at a bare minimum you need 3 hours. Despite the cartoon version being less than 2, I feel that it was heavily truncated and lacked depth - as it is a kid's cartoon. Nothing wrong with that, but it's not a complete adaptation that includes everything.!&lt;

&gt;!Technically, I've heard that following page to minute ratio/if it was adapted the same length the LOTR movies were, the movie should fall around the 2-2.5 hour range, but as we can see with fan edits of The Hobbit following the book and being 4 hours, page ratios aren't particularity useful and don't at all work for making a good movie that covers the whole book. !&lt;

TheHobbit,"New to this sub so this has probably been discussed, but the significance of The Battle of The Five Armies is very underrated","I just re-read the hobbit over the course of the last week. After finishing it I was dwelling on the battle and realized if the Dwarves and Elves and Men had lost The Battle of The 5 Armies, Middle Earth might be completely doomed. 

Firstly, the hord of gold and wealth inside Erebor would fall into the hands of the goblins making them that much more powerful. And assuming all the leaders of the losing army are killed in the battle, that means the Dwarves of the Iron Hills are now leaderless, and without 500 of their most seasoned soldiers. The same could be said of the elves of Mirkwood. The Men of Lake Town are already in a tough spot prior to the battle, relying on the aid of the Elves so they would essentially be dead as well. This region of the world's best hope at that point would lie in a joint effort by Dwarves and Elves to lay seige to a conquered Erebor full of goblins, which in their weakened state would have been no small task, even if they decided to work together. And we know given their history that does not happen often. If they had the help of the eagles they could probably pull it off, but that's also no guarantee. 

Also, If the goblins and wargs had won the battle, presumably Bilbo would've been killed. Though invisible, he did suffer a nasty blow to the head that knocked him unconscious until after the battle was won. If he had woken up to a battle that had been lost however, there's a good chance he would never have made it out alive, despite having the ring (Unsure whether invisibility would remain if he died tbh, I'd assume no).That means the ring would have likely passed into the hands of the goblins and then eventually into the hands of Sauron, years before the events of LOTR, before Gandalf and company were necessarily even aware Bilbos ring had been ""The Ring"". 

TLDR; Elves, Men, Dwarves all heavily weakened and the forces of evil now have a stronghold in Erebor filled with gold, as well as the single most powerful weapon in the world."

TheHobbit,Azog is a coward,I am a bigger fan than most of both the lord of the rings and the hobbit movies and as I am sitting her watching the battle of the five armies I finally decided to see if anybody else felt the same about Azog. Obviously he is a really bad dude and none of us like him at least in the context of the story. He is a really good villain. That being said his cowardice is so frustrating. He is supposed to be the biggest and the baddest orc to have ever walked middle earth and yet he is so much of a coward he never really duels anybody one on one. I guess you could count the duel he and Thorin have during the battle of Moria as a one vs one. However in that battle he cuts his arm sliced off by a dwarf half his size. His death in the battle of the five armies is hardly a one vs one but that is the next closest thing. He starts a duel with Thorin but is so much of a coward that he gets knocked down and sicks his army on Thorin. So Thorin kills like 50 orcs and then goes back to his duel with Azog. Literally every fight they have Azog gets destroyed and then sicks his minions on Thorin which is what evens the odds. Cowardice like that drives me crazy. Says he vows to wipeout their bloodline and yet he cannot do it at all. Yes they all end up dead but he couldn‚Äôt have ever done it with out an army. Not one but two armies. I guess it is just more of a testament of how skilled Thorin was as a warrior as well as Azog was a coward. If I am honest here I really wish that Tolkein had kept the younger sons of Durin alive. For the story to end up as much of a heartstrings tugging moment Thorin had to die but not necessarily Phili and Killi. It is definitely a far cry from how the lord of the rings trilogy ended up. With the exception of Boromirs death it was a fairly happy ending. Unless you considered Gandalfs initial death in that too. Anyway I spend too much time in my head pondering the tolkeinverse.
TheHobbit,Drinking game for hobbit trilogy,"ey whatup r/TheHobbit people, im searching for a good drinking game for the hobbit trilogy. We plan to drink shots and the game isnt suposed to be super complicated. At best it would be only one scenario we drink, not like 50 scenarios like in the games i found online. We are watching the normal movies, so no extended stuff.

If you could post a good game in the comments that would be great.

TheHobbit,How I would have handled the Thrush in BoFA,"What do you think of this idea, to fix the lack of Thrush in BoFA, with two short shorts:

Shot 1: Bard is running on rooftops while Smaug attacks. He looks up shocked as Smaug destroys the Windlance! He turns away in horror and despair. His last hope is gone.

Shot 2: The Thrush dashes past Bard and he follows it with his eyes. The bird draws his gaze toward the missing scale on Smaug's chest. Filled with restored hope Bard makes his way to the Bell Tower.

I feel like these shots would take less than a few seconds, but would go a long way in tying together the whole Thrush and windlance concepts from the previous two films, which frustratingly went nowhere.

 What do you think?"

The other scene is of peter Jackson talking about how Sir ian mckellen always gets last say over the dialogue of Gandalf and talking about how he cares the books with him and is never shy to pull them out and point out that Gandalf would say X Y and Z instead of the latter. It then showed the scene of Gandalf shouting up to Thorin ""do not damage my burglar, if you do not like him return him to me...etc""

Reading The Hobbit for the first time, and comparing it to the film (2/3) - The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug https://old.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/ovsqkd/reading_the_hobbit_for_the_first_time_and/

I just finished reading The Hobbit. My thoughts are moderately positive toward it, but I think I would have liked it way more if I had read it when I was younger. Maybe because I was already exposed to various fantasy tropes this book originated, it did not leave a deep impression on me. It was a fun, lighthearted read.

It is clear that Jackson tried to make The Hobbit into The Lord of the Rings prequels by adapting the book into something more epic and darker, but what is interesting is that the book already does what Jackson thought he was doing. The novel goes surprisingly dark with the dragon raid on the Lake-town showing terrible consequences from the dwarves' action. In the movie, the destruction does not land as hard as the book because the film sandwiched this between the extra grimdark materials that were not in the book with the necromancer and Azorg stuff. Unlike the book in which the gradual tonal shift is subtler and consistent, the films seemed to always lean toward the darker side since the first film. The film also shoves distracting things into what was already fairly dark and serious to make it siller for some reason? The book has the Lake-town destruction to be catastrophic, and then the film tries to whitewash it. If you want to make The Hobbit darker, why not focus on darkening what was already dark in the book? Watching the film, whenever Legolas, Kili, Taruiel, Sebastian, and Azog appear in the desolate Lake-town as people moan and cry during the aftermath, they feel like they have stepped into the sets from the wrong films.

The change I am more on the fence about is the motivations for all parties. The Lord of the Rings had the seduction of power as the central theme, The Hobbit had greed for wealth as the central theme, and all the main characters are being seduced by the enormous treasure left by Thror. The Hobbit films seem to remove this ""greed"" aspect out of the story and replaced it with something closer to The Lord of the Rings.

In the book, the dwarves are not heroic or noble. Even when they are depicted as morally questionable in the films, they always seem brave and confident. Lazy and cowardly are not the words I would attribute, but they sort of are in the books. They push Bilbo to do the most reckless things. Thorin seems outright petty, also. In the movies, Thorin goes through this somewhat Boromir-style character arc from an honorable leader to a greedy man in front of treasures, then redeeming himself to the former. The film even features the overt ""Thorin going mad"" and the dwarves trying to make him come to sense.  In the book, it seems Thorin was always that kind of guy in the first place. For example, in the movies, the Arkenstone is a symbol of the succession of the Durin royal family. The reason Thorin is obsessed with the Arkenstone is that he needs it to set the kingship and gather the dwarves together. That was Thorin's goal in the first place, a fairly noble one at that. In the book, the Arkenstone seems to be just one of many important treasures, so greed was the main motivation from the very beginning. In the case of the change regarding the dwarves, it works. I like the added scene before Thorin and his party joins the battle that was absent in the book, and we see how Thorin changes his mind in a convincing manner. I never felt bad for Thorin's death in the book because we never saw his redemption. The same plot point in the film hits much harder because Thorin is likable and we can understand why Bilbo would have a genuine affection for him.

However, the film tries to change the motivations for the rest of the factions: Azog, Thranduil, and Bard, and this is where it fails. The elven king in the book is equally terrible as Thorin who tried to steal the empty Erebor by raising an army for wealth. Bard, the one who is the noblest out of them all, also occasionally shows his ambitions for money. The goblins invade Erebor because they wanted gold, plus Thorin and his party pissed them off by ravaging their hideout. In the film, the elven king is so saddened by his wife's death that he goes to war for some jewels that were supposed to belong to his wife, which comes across as ridiculous. Bard has zero greed or desire for money in the film. The goblins invade Erebor because Sauron ordered them to do so and Azog wanted revenge against Thorin. Instead, all these negative characteristics were poured into the Lake-town master, who turns from an ordinary ruler into irresponsible human garbage. Changing The Hobbit from a simpler morality tale into some sort of LOTR prequel deep human drama distracts from the narrative core of the story. It makes the story messier.

The film also makes a baffling decision to keep omitting Bilbo out of most of the battle. In the book, the battle lasts a few pages so we don't really miss much by not having Bilbo participating in the fight. The entire third film is about the battle. Why not change this and actually have Bilbo participate in the fight when you are changing everything else? The film focuses on everything that is not related to Bilbo, like Sauron, Legolas, Kili and Tauriel romance, Azog, Bard... The film is called The Hobbit. Tell the story from the hobbit's perspective. If you want to make an actual connection to The Lord of the Rings, have Biblo participate in the battle then be horrified by the war like Frodo in the ending of Return of the King.  Or have Bilbo use Mithril in the fight so that he can realize how powerful this armor is, connecting it to why Bilbo gave Frodo this armor.

Despite the long screentime, because the film focuses on everything else, the actual time devoted to the A plot is surprisingly strict. One of my favorite moments in the book is when the dwarves prepare for the battle, they hear the elven song from the enemy camp and are moved by it. They muse if things had been different, so they sing back their song. This is absent in the film. This is the little moment that could have been shown in the film in the form of a montage like Pippin's song from Return of the King, showing the preparations for the battle from all sides.

The Hobbit novel is a solid book, and the film adaptation seems to be better to watch through Youtube clips rather than the full film. I don't think I would jump into reading The Lord of the Rings anytime soon. Its length is like six times of The Hobbit, which I already struggled a bit reading because of the oldschool writing style."

I have been continuing to read The Hobbit, and I have read up to Chapter 13, which is the point where the film, The Desolation of Smaug adapted.

One of the things prevalent in the book but not depicted in the film is how long it takes to do anything. Even when the events are not necessarily skipped in the films, they breeze through them. Each individual plot beat feels like it took only a day or hours for them to went through. In the books, each chapter takes days or weeks. The author goes over smaller details other books would not even care for. It gives a sense of the scale of Middle-Earth without explicitly telling the reader how big it is. Now, I am not criticizing the films for this obmission, and this is certainly what should have been done in a two to three-hour visual medium. I am pointing out the inherent difference between the two experiences.

One of the unfortunate victims of this streamlining is the Beron part. In the book, Gandalf uses his storytelling skill to convince Beorn to invite the dwarves into his home by introducing them two by two. I love the wits and humor displayed on the page, showing how cunning Gandalf is. It works as a smart exposition for the readers, as the exposition plays alongside the tension of whether Gandalf will succeed or not. In the film, Gandalf tries to do this but fails, but Beron invites the dwarves anyway? It is unfortunate that this whole section is relegated to the expositions about Azog and the presence of orcs without the ingenuity of the original scene had.

The Mirkwood is way more suspenseful in the book. This chapter nearly ends their journey. It is the most grueling and intense part of the book. The characters starve. They cannot see anything. There is a constant threat lurking near them for days. It even messes with the minds. Barely any of this is translated in the film. The forest seems bright and colorful. The length is short. When things go down, it is just another action scene. While the involvement of the elves during the escape scene makes for more economical storytelling, it is also unfortunate that instead of Bilbo and the dwarves' skills and wits saving themselves, it is just the elves coming to rescue them.

The wood elven realm scene is interesting that, while in the films, Bilbo's character shift from a coward to a heroic figure occurs right after the cliff scene at the end of An Unexpected Journey, with Biblo saving Thorin from Azorg, the nearly similar moment is already in the book with Bilbo freeing the dwarves from the elven realm in Mirkwood. Even Thorin thanking Bilbo is almost identical to the moment in the movie, just the placement is different. Because An Unexpected Journey gave Bilbo a forced character arc that was not in the early part of the book, so I initially thought the book was lacking character growth, but actually, Bilbo in the novel has more developments than the films as the story goes on. Bible is a bit edgier and blunter. There are more arguments between Bilbo and the dwarves. He almost becomes a leader, plans out and tells the dwarves what to do. 

Despite being a children's book, I think The Hobbit appeals more to adults than kids because of Bilbo because he is the type of character that adults can relate to. His life is built on everyday, security, and comfort but underneath it all, he craves adventure, despite being afraid to pursue it. It is like why one of the reasons why people love Star Wars, Harry Potter, Spirited Away, and The Matrix--boring people going out to adventure--a feeling many adults who are trapped in mundane daily lives can relate to. Another thing is, despite him being caught up in dangers and not always successful in his actions, he is always proactive. He is an unlikely underdog, puts others‚Äô safety and happiness in front of his own, is taken advantage of, and pushes on despite his misfortunes. This is central to adventure stories. The jumbled, fractured, episodic plot structure can be overlooked if you nail the protagonist because if we find the main character endearing, we will want to go anywhere with them. 

The biggest downside of the films is how they constantly shift away from Bilbo for pointless fluffs. Despite how the book is structured, it is still a tight story because it is mostly told from Bilbo's POV. It is about experiencing this bizarre gonzo adventure from his fresh-eyed perspective. They cast the perfect actor for Bilbo Baggins, then made a trilogy of films about everything else other than Bilbo. After every beat, they go, what's happening to Gandalf? What's happening to this big bad orc? What's happening to Legolas? What's happening to this OC elf hotness? How about her love triangle with the dwarf and Legolas? None of the side stuff matters to taking back the treasures from Smaug, so why even focus on them? Those runtimes could have been spent showing the chemistry between Bilbo and dwarves. I like the White Council scene because it is already in the book, just expanded. For the others, the only connection between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings needs is the ring. You can cut everything else, and no one would notice.

One genuine improvement the film makes is the Smaug confrontation. This is the best part of the trilogy, and the changes are mostly for the better. The book has Bilbo going into Smaug's lair twice, and Smaug notices that one of his treasures is missing...? Out of millions of those treasures, Smaug notices a cup is gone, which is ridiculous. It shortens it and takes full advantage of the visual plus audio medium and showcases the true threat of Smaug, and the scene is far more dynamic, with Bilbo sneaking, paying attention to golden coins falling, Smaug chasing after him. Bilbo exposes himself to Smaug, which adds to the tension. Here, Smaug can kill Bilbo at any moment, but he keeps talking because of how bored and lonely he is, so he wants someone to talk to for a minute. The only problem is that the film lacks the 'riddle' aspect. The book explains that dragons love riddles like Gollum. Every word that comes out of Bilbo‚Äôs mouth is for a good reason so Smaug will waste time trying to figure out what it means. Every single sentence that comes out of his mouth feels like the moving of a chess piece. Unfortunately, in the movie, Bilbo survives by sheer luck.

The proceeding action setpiece is... bad. In the book, Smaug eat up all the ponies and the dwarves shudder in fear, and we feel it.  It is one of the most suspenseful parts of the book as the dragon hunts the dwarves down. In the film, they go on to kill the dragon in the lair, and 8 out of 10 should have instantly died in the first minute. This whole sequence could have been cut.

Except for bilbo. It's been about 8 years since I've read the book so this isn't meant as a comparison to the book and merely from a movie perspective. 

I just didn't feel anything from him. Martin Freeman portrayed bilbos awkwardness perfectly and didn't per se act bad, he just lacked any kind of emotion. Bilbo would make these speeches about how much he valued the dwarves but it didn't feel the slightest bit like that. He just always seemed annoyed and uncertain and unhappy. Obviously this isn't a drama and as such the relationships aren't the main focus and get less screen time, but I didn't feel the same way about any other character. Even the ""side"" dwarves made me feel more emotional than bilbo. Their actors really portrayed their emotions, attachment to each other and!!! for bilbo well. The scenes with thorin and bilbo always make me tear up, but only because you can feel how sincere thorins love for bilbo is. Bilbo on the other hand? A brick wall. The entire three movies it felt like he didn't give a damn about the dwarves or anything he was doing. 


Now, this isn't meant as a critique of Martin freeman, he's good in a lot of other stuff and could just be not fit for this role or have gotten bad directions,  for those he isn't to be blamed."

I have only experienced Tolkien through the films. So far, I have read up to Chapter 6, which is the point where the film, An Unexpected Journey, adapted. Then I watched the first film again to understand how the film differs.

So far I'm liking the book, but I am not loving it. I would have liked it more if I read it when I was a pre-teen though. Tolkien's old writing style caught me off-guard at first. In the modern writing style, the proses are intimate and microscopic, told from the perspective of a single POV character. In The Hobbit, it has a distant, macroscopic perspective to everything, as if this is the story told by a narrator. Some of the word choices are unfortunate to read today, with the words like ""faggot"" and ""queer"" having outdated meanings rather than how we use them now. There are a lot of 'and then's and adverbs, which modern writers avoid for easier comprehension for readers. There are many songs, even goblins and elves sing. Tolkien's writing style feels as if it is meant to be read aloud. Sightreading the book makes it difficult to absorb.

It has a structure of a fairy tale that several elements get introduced and disappear. It is actually closer to Alice in Wonderland than a conventional epic fantasy novel. For example, Gandalf sort of disappears out of nowhere so many times without explanations. In many chapters, Bilbo does nothing, just follows the company without a chance to show what he can do. Each chapter is a self-contained 20-30 page story and the story speeds and flows in a brief manner.

Since I watched the films first, I have noticed how the films deviated from the book as I read, and honestly, many changes Jackson made are not bad. Bilbo's personality is way likable in the films. He is more introverted: fearful and shy. In the book, he has certain pride, bluffs, and a flush of passion. How Bilbo joined the journey is far more compelling. In the book, the song Misty Mountains comes out right after the joyful song on the table, which is repetitive and creates a narrative dissonance. The film paces it to be the last scene in the night so it would motivate him to go on the adventure. This is pretty cool.

The troll scene is better, too. In the book, Bilbo, again, really does nothing. He pleads that he is an amazing cook, but fails. In the film, Bilbo's ""worms"" bluffing works and is hilarious. It makes Bilbo use his wits, and that is his character trait. The section also serves the visual medium better. In the book, the trolls catch the dwarves by... sneaking and covering them with sacks, despite their enormous size? And Gandalf tricks them by pretending to be one of the trolls to buy time until the morning? Like, how do they not notice his voice is different??? If the sunrise was that imminent, why did the trolls not flee earlier? All these would not fly in the visual medium, although the dwarves sacrificing themselves for Bilbo makes little sense at this moment.

I like the movie Thorin way more. In the book, Thorin is closer to the European aristocrat type. He is stingy, egotistical, and sly. He is giddy when things go right, and blames Bilbo when things go wrong. He pushes Bilbo to dangerous places. In the movie Thorin still has 'boomer energy', but he has certain dignity to his presence as a leader. When Smaug invaded Erebor, in the book, Thorin explains he survived because he was outside Erebor. In the films, Thorin led the dwarves to fight Smaug and led the survivors out of the kingdom. The film represents him as the foremost leader of the dwarf race.

Even the tiniest example like the introduction is different. When Bilbo opens the door, in the book, Thorin falls under Bombur, Bopur, and Bipur on the carpet. In the movie, Thorin arrives later alone, which gives him more significance in the group. However, the most striking difference is when he got captured by the goblin king. In the book, Thorin bows down. In the movie, Thorin shows an attitude and never sways by the goblin king's provocations. One of my favorite changes in the movie is when the party arrives at Rivendell. In the book, everything is super friendly, No animosity, no drama, everything is inviting for the dwarves. In the films, Thorin holds grudge against the elves because of their betrayal during the fall of his kingdom., which sets up Thorin's feud between the dwarves and the Mirkwood elves in the climax.

Thorin deciding to go on the adventure without Gandalf gives him an active personality to his character. In the book, Gandalf just comes along then disappears briefly when the goblins attack them, and Gandalf explaining how he disappeared makes... little sense? Like, I'm not sure why this plot point is in the book. The film changes this to boost Thorin's character, and it is better.

The biggest huddle of the film is that the films add so many fats that do not belong in the story. While I like the narrative framing of the story being Bilbo's writing in the 'current day', the film goes on, and on with this that it loses the momentum. We get another sequence in which we see the fall of the dwarf kingdom in the very opening, which should have been moved to where Thorin tells Bilbo in his house as he did in the book, or should have been placed in the opening of the second or third movie, so we understand the contexts of the battle of five armies.

Because the book is paced fast and short, there is no moment for the individual dwarves to show their distinct personalities. This is what the film could have improved upon the book, but the film instead opts out for adding extra stuff absent in the book to tie into The Lord of the Rings. Dwarves in the films feel even more set-dressing than their counterparts. Some of the dialogue cut from the book for the sake of the Sauron stuff is unfortunate. I love the exchanges between Thorin and Gandalf in the book, and most of them are omitted.

The added Radagast portion is boring as hell, and the film drags... drags... drags... He is only in the film for the Sauron reveal, who has no relation to the story in the book. The added presence of Saruman in the elven council scene is cool, but again, he is there for Sauron stuff. And we get this Azog character as a big baddie who chases after our characters, and he does not fit in this story. The film constantly builds up to this villain who was not in the book, and he is generic as hell. He is boring. He renders the goblin escape scene pointless in the film. In the book, the party was cornered by the goblins and wolves because they were captured in the cavern, held as prisoners, and escaped, so the goblins chased after the party. In the film, the orcs always chased after our heroes, so regardless of whether the party got captured in the cavern, the orcs would have caught up to them anyway.

We also get a botched character arc for Bilbo. Rather than his growth as a burglar and getting respect from the dwarves being gradual as in the book, An Unexpected Journey warps up his arc. Instead of the amusing dialogue scene between Gandalf and the Eagles, we get this half-assed resolution to the tension between Bilbo and Thorin. 

What The Hobbit should have expanded is not the bloated extra materials that were not in the book like Sauron, Radagast, or a bunch of intense action set-pieces. The films should have expanded the dialogues and psyches of the individual dwarves, and their dynamics with Bilbo. So I feel The Hobbit would have worked much better as a TV series with each episode being 22-25 minutes long, adapting per chapter. Fill the scripts with the witty banters between Bilbo and dwarves. This TV structure would have even allowed Sauron's return to integrate into the narrative more seamlessly as well because every episode is episodic. In one episode, we see the dwarves' journey, in the other, we see Gandalf's journey. In the film's format, it just makes the narrative messy."
TheHobbit,Did thorinn initially try and enter the lonely mountain before the events of the hobbit,"Did thorinn try and sneak through the treasure in the lonely mountain before realising he needed a burgular. I cant find anywhere that he did but his golden harp is a enigma to me then.

It says on page 17 he has a golden harp wrapped in green cloth that is described in much more detail dissimilar to the 2 viols that were brought in with it, normally you would just go hey he is a king except in song on the next page it has the line

""And harps of gold; where no man delves""

This has probably been seen before but i just thought it worth mention since i couldnt find he had been there before other then when they initially fled online.
With the assumption he returned because i dont think a golden harp is the first thing you grab when fleeing a dragon"

TheHobbit,Looking for a good illustrated version of The Hobbit.,"As the title says I'm looking for a good illustrated version of the hobbit. I read the book when I was young but I'd like to read it to my 9 year old son at night and have it be friendly for younger kids as I have another on the way as well. 

Any advice is appreciated, durability a plus and not really concerned about cost."
TheHobbit,Somewhere in an alternate Universe...," In a hole in the mountain, there lived a dwarf. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a dwarf-hole, and that means mithril.

It had a perfectly hidden door, indistinguishable from the rock wall, with an ornate doorway visible only in moonlight. The door opened, when the appropriate password was spoke, to a very large square hall: a very comfortable square hall without smoke, with marble walls, and floors tiled, provided with ornate carvings, and lots and lots of mithril- the dwarf was fond of mithril. The hall wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the mountain ‚Äì The Mountain, as all the people for many miles round called it ‚Äì and many corridors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the dwarf: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries, wardrobes, kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor or the few below it, and indeed many on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones lit by a bright vein of mithril running along the one wall.

This dwarf was a very well-to-do dwarf, and his name was Boggins.

(I wrote this years ago with the intention of rewriting the entire book--which, of course, never happened--and my sister recently reminded me of it so I thought I'd share)"
TheHobbit,The Battle of 5 Armies Question,"I just finished watching The Three Hobbit Movies (not all on the same day): The Unexpected Journey, The Desolation of Smaug and Lastly The Battle of The Five Armies. I‚Äôm then I‚Äôm heading on the journey to watch The Lord of The Rings Movies.

But for The Hobbit: Battle of The 5 Armies, I  have a question, I know that there is The Elf Army, The Dwarf Army, The Human Army, and The Orc Army but who is the the 5th army?

TheHobbit,What the fuck Gandalf,How and why does Gandalf let bilbo keep the ring. It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense they‚Äôre all tweaking about Saurons return literally saying as long as he doesn‚Äôt get the ring they‚Äôll be ok-but then jus leaves it with nobody to guard at all-probably in the least secure place it could possibly be. Does he know what‚Äôs gonna happen or something?
TheHobbit,Who‚Äôs the king ?,Just finished rewatching the movies-haven‚Äôt read the books in years and now that all 3 of the durin bloodline dwarves died whos the king. I thought it would be Dain but it appears he and his army went home and didn‚Äôt stay in erebor. So is it just the 9 dwarves chillin with billions of gold coins and a entire mountain or what
TheHobbit,Something small (and possibly over analyzed) I thought of while watching ‚ÄòAn Unexpected Journey‚Äô,"Okay so I have limited knowledge of the Hobbit/LotR in general because i‚Äôve only watched the movies, but that scene at the beginning where all the dwarves show up at Bilbo‚Äôs house, I know they‚Äôre comedically supposed to be rude guests by eating all the food, but what always struck me as a little out of character was Gandalf joining in and encouraging it - until I realized that Gandalf probably reasoned that the food would go bad anyways if it wasn‚Äôt eaten, since he fully expected Bilbo to tag along.  Idk I may just be reading into it too much, Gandalf also seems kind of chaotic anyways so maybe it could be in character"

TheHobbit,A Simple Magic Ring,"I'm ignoring the LotR for this question, it's a question about how JRR Tolkien wrote about the magic ring, that turned one invisible. There is a parallel ring in some of Plato's writing, Ring of Gyges, 2nd chapter of the Republic. It would be difficult to imagine JRR Tolkien didn't know the writing. In fact it is so parallel I assume Tolkien is actually addressing a counter myth at Plato's Ring of Gyges. 

Plato holds that all people are inherently bad, and proffers a mental experiment where one imagines the Ring of Gyges, a ring that could turn the bearer invisible at their will. Plato goes on to say that such an Invisible Man (just like the movie by the same name), fearing no diminishment of reputation, would not stop continuously escalating crimes until passing a villainy threshold from which redemption is not possible.  Plato is pretty clear in his view that all men would become rapists, sadists and murders. 

In Gollum, we have an Invisible Man, after 500 years of it. I do not believe that Gollum says how he got the ring in The Hobbit, or even whether he is a hobbit or not. We still see a man in possession of an exceptional ring, and he is so pathetic. With no standards for himself, and invisibility to hide his shame, he becomes bestial. 

And then Bilbo gets the ring. As is often in JRR Tolkien's works, good manners save the protagonists from damnation. Because of his decency he rarely or never wears it. He never imbibes the potential for crimes. 

Is this something JRR Tolkien ever addressed directly, that is the rings in his work, and the Ring of Gyges?"

It's like a whole different film, I actually enjoyed everything except Legolas, or should I say, badly animated, Super-Legolas!

What a surprise, but then I thought to myself, maybe I'm getting used to the movie. I assumed the extended version would just have longer scenes, not a complete re-edit! Am I imagining things? Are these films all different from one another? Any insight would be helpful, Thanks in advance."

TheHobbit,Just my opinion but...,"I honestly can't rank the hobbit movies. I just love them all equally and serious can't manage to individually rank them all. However, if I HAD to then this would probably be mine:

1.) Unexpected Journey

2.) Desolation of Smaug

3.) Battle of the Five Armies

&amp;#x200B;

Again, for me they're all equal but I put them in this order because Unexpected Journey is probably the most nostalgic out of the 3 for me and its surprisingly emotional. Desolation is probably the strongest in terms of story and I actually like a lot of the additions that Jackson made. Battle of the Five Armies is in third place because the theatrical edition is good but feels quite rushed and is no where near the quality of the extended edition in my opinion. The ending is also really great and satisfying.

This is just my opinion though"

But between being with family and being by myself, this song came to mind and I haven't stopped thinking about him and all the fond memories I had growing up with him. He wasn't really a fan of LOTR or fantasy in general. He was like a couple pegs down from Ned Flanders (or more like Sam in terms of how much he liked gardening).

But yeah, it's been a day. Like it literally came out of nowhere and we spent the whole day making funeral arrangements. I almost made it the whole day without crying, even amongst all my other family. But I got home, and after just feeling so empty, I thought about this song out of nowhere and it finally broke me listening to it.

I'm not religious or spiritual. But the first verse really sticks out to me most and helps me think he's at least in a better place: Under cloud, beneath the stars, over snow and winter's morn, I turn at last to paths that lead home. And though where the road then takes me, I cannot tell. We came all this way, but now comes the day to bid you farewell

TheHobbit,Build-A-Bear + The Hobbit,"We all loved Build-A-Bear‚Äôs release of The Lord of the Rings bears. These beautifully designed bears with their clothes and clever foot designs were delightfully received by J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs fans, and sold out in its entirety within a day.

I am hoping to encourage, perhaps convince, them to also makes bears for The Hobbit. In a series of design posts on Instagram, I aim to show not only that The Hobbit films, though divisive, are just as valued as The Lord of the Rings, and that there is support for these bears and ready customers willing to buy these products.

The designs on the Instagram page will include a Thorin bear (‚ÄúBearin Oakenshield‚Äù), a Bilbo bear (‚ÄúBearbo Baggins‚Äù), a Smaug to match their Gollum release, and a separate Orcrist sword to match Sting. I will also have a go at designing the clothes for these bears based on the characters‚Äô costumes.

Born in 1997, I‚Äôve grown up with Build-A-Bear, and to see them doing Tolkien, which is my special interest, brought me such joy and excitement. I feel like if enough support is shown, and if I get their attention frequently enough, they would be willing to do more Tolkien bears. I may even design more for other LOTR characters if people enjoy it! My main goal is The Hobbit.

Please follow, like, and share to help garner support for this little project, as well as showing Build-A-Bear that we would love bears for The Hobbit just as much as for The Lord of the Rings. üêªü§éüíô You can find the Instagram account at: buildabearthehobbit.

Thank you so much in advance if you can drop a like or tag Build-A-Bear in the comments of the post. I always appreciate the support of other The Hobbit fans. We‚Äôve always got to stick together!"

TheHobbit,"Amazon, mgm and balin's quest that we all need"," Now that Amazon has bought MGM, a possibility has opened up that I never would have thought possible. In fact, if tomorrow Amazon decides to develop a spin off on Balin and its mission to reclaim Moria, I think nothing would stop them. In my opinion, a spin-off like this would be a winning operation, for the simple fact that Balin is one of the best things about the hobbit, and both those who love the hobbit trilogy (like me) and those who do not appreciate it, recognize that balin is a great character, for this reason doing a spin off on him regarding his journey to reclaim moria would be a great idea, not only could we revisit the middle earth closer to the events of lotr, but there would be the possibility of developing a character like ori, who in the hobbit seemed very interesting but had little space, also they could finally show us the female dwarves. I imagine this story as a film of 2 hours maximum, or as a spin off episode of the amazon series. 

 However, there are conditions under which to see this story and some obstacles I would like to solve:

 \- the director, my first choice would be Peter Jackson, the reason is that it was he brought Balin alive on screen, and he did a great job, but I realize this will never happen because Jackson is tired of middle earth movies, understandably. Another perfect director for this story would be Guillermo del Toro, think about it, he could finally make all the pre-production work he did with the hobbit worthwhile, and he'd have a lot of fun with the watcher on the water and other brand new creatures hiding in the Depth of Moria (uvanimor), he also would have a lot of freedom since there is no book that tells you what to do, just some information regarding the general plot. However, I believe that even this occurrence is highly unlikely, so here is my third choice: Ja Bayona, the director of the amazon series. Bayona is a director of great visual talent, who has nothing to envy to Jackson or Del Toro, he is a director who has managed to make jurassic world 2 watchable thanks to his direction, in this regard I recommend watching the first two episodes of penny dreadful which were directed by him and are a masterpiece in terms of intensity and visual power. 

 \- what could be the cornerstone of this story? In my opinion the first would be the parallelism between balin and thorin, in fact  balin would lead an expedition to obtain their ancient home, but this time the dwarves fail. And here the second theme comes into play: sacrifice, in order not to leave a too dark  ending, I would do a flash-forward to show the dwarves return to Moria and find the remains of balin and his companions, here we would see the dwarves rebuild their kingodm, in this way, balin's dream would become true thanks to his descendants. What do you think, would you like to see something like this?"

I've been looking at quite a few fan recut but none of them quite satisfied me.

The best I found was The Tolkien Edit, but there are some things that bother me a lot :

* Why remove Beorn introduction scene, it's in the book, and granted that it's not the same it was quite good IMHO.
* Removing the mine fight scene was a strange take as it creates an incoherence when Smaug exits the mine covered in gold for no apparent reason.
* Overall the recut of the Battle of the Five Armies feels a bit off, it's a lot better because I think it was FAR TOO LONG in the original movie, but it feels off and you don't always understand what's going on...

It's the only things that really bother me and I would like to know if there is a fancut that fixe these ""issues"" before looking into doing a recut myself üòÖ"

TheHobbit,The M4 Hobbit Book Edit.,"I originally found this edit a few months back, and it's become my personal favorite way to watch the Hobbit. 
M4 took the extended cuts of the three films and cut them down into one extended cut very much in the same vein as the extended LOTR cuts. 

Split into two parts, this edit is a fresh new take on the movies which follows the books very closely. With the help of the community, M4 brings you a product with updated vfx for continuity (such as removing Bain completely and replacing him with a wooden post when Bard kills Smaug), well mixed audio complete with subtitles (although some languages are still being worked on), and a soon to release Blu-Ray ISO file that you can burn onto a disc (M4 has also created cover and disc art so it can stand completed in case in your movie collection).

TheHobbit,"My theory regarding Beorn, Bolg and Dol Goldur","In a behind the scenes video of the hobbit, it is possible to see an orc in props in dol goldur, the same orc killed by galadriel in the battle of the five armies. Originally He was supposed to be azog, but at some point jackson decided he was bolg, (before the rivalry between legolas and bolg was entered and bolg was replaced with cgi).

There are photos of beorn in dol goldur (where he was tortured). now, i think that in the trilogy beorn doesn't have a real role or story arc, but before the movie's release, Jackson and Mikael persbrandt, (beorn's actor), talked about the important role he would have, (role probably thought for the two structure movie). 

Furthermore, there is a video of gandalf talking to radagast and beorn, and I think this is a scene that takes place after the white council saves gandalf. Based on all this information, my theory is this: Somewhere in some secret vault, there is some footage showing beorn prisoner in dol goldur being tortured by bolg, I think this scene would have been a flashback to the past of beorn, because if you notice, in the film beorn still wears a chain on his arm, but I do not exclude that it was a later scene, when gandalf is saved by the white council in dol goldur, in fact originally radagast would have had his heroic moment saving beorn, so i read on the internet.

I think that in the footage that exists but we have never seen, (and maybe we will never see), beorn had a rivalry with bolg, and since this bolg in props was present in  dol goldur set, I think this rivalry would have ended in a clash between the two, in which beorn allegedly killed Bolg and avenged his people, before leaving dol goldur with radagst and Gandalf, while the council was fighting sauron. This storyline, which has been cut in favor of legolas vs cgi bolg, would not only give more screen time to one of the best prop orcs I've ever seen, but it would also make sense of the beorn character, which sadly has no real reason to exist in the version of the movie we had.

What do you think?   would you like to see this storyline? to see beorn fighitng a massive props orc at dol goldur? to see him finally have a real role and arc redemption?  I honestly do, and I hope that maybe it will be part of the bonuses of the new collector's edition of this summer"

TheHobbit,Can someone help me out with these questions,
TheHobbit,"From the bottom of my heart, to Peter Jackson and the fans","Greetings From Italy, (and forgive me for any writing error), I am a great lover of Sir Peter Jackson's films, and I am here to write these words in the vain hope of being able to move something, but first, a little context...

What can I say, one of my first memories concerns the vision of the lord of the rings, and I cannot explain in words how much that film stimulated my creativity and made me passionate about cinema. Growing up I recovered Peter Jackson's other films in no particular order, king kong (a masterpiece in my opinion), bad taste and splatters (films that made me realize that everyone can make films even without too many means at their disposal, the important thing is dedication), then moving on to heavenly creatures and lovely bones. But I'm not here to praise a director I love, I'm here to make a request regarding the hobbit. We all know the production issues that there have been, and honestly, I really appreciate the hobbit trilogy, which is exactly why I'm writing this. I know the experience of working on that film wasn't the most exciting for Peter, he had a lot of problems, most of all the lack of pre-production, and honestly, although I really appreciate the hobbit trilogy, I think it has a few flaws...

Normally I would go over it, and enjoy these films without problems, accepting their great strengths, and their various defects, but this is not the case, since, every time I watch the hobbit, I am deeply convinced that Mr Jackson did something incredible, there are so many wonderful scenes in that trilogy, which are all worthy of the heights of Jackson's career, and at the same time, I have a feeling that the flaws, (including the fact that bilbo almost becomes a secondary character), would be easily solved through editing. Now I would like to expose you the scenes that in my opinion are worthy of Jackson's best work:

1. The prologue of Erebor, as far as I'm concerned, is exceptional from every point of view, cgi, writing, directing, interpreting, the way Jackson plays with the silhouette of the dragon is brilliant. 

 2. Everything about bilbo and the dwarves, starting from the beginning (the bilbo dinner), up to the end (the return home, with bilbo finding the handkerchief). The actors are all great, there is a good differentiation between the various dwarves, freeman and armitage do an amazing job, Peter Jackson has always worked with great actors, but honestly, at least for me, these two are just beyond. 

3. All major plot steps:

\-The trolls; 

\- goblin town has an incredible cgi, if you pause the movie during those scenes, you will notice that all the goblins have different facial features; 

\-gollum: just wow, no need to add more, -the eagles scene, so some don't like Azog, but honestly I think it has great animations and I really like the design; 

\-Mirkwood, here Jackson shoots a wonderful ""claustrophobic"" scene as only he could, and Spiders have an exceptional CGI; 

\- the comparison tha thorin and thranduil is wonderful; 

\-Laketown, the thing I really appreciate about Laketown is the visual impact that is different from any other place we've seen in the saga, and Luke Evans is a great Bard; 

\- the entrance to erebor is an extremely intense scene, with Bilbo solving the riddle and Thorin grabbing the key before he falls 

\-Smaug:the best dragon in the history of cinema, with a phenomenal Benedict Cumberbatch, a CGI that hasn't aged by a single day, and, at least for me, the best villain in the whole saga, the eye of smaug that visually recalls Suaron, in general the whole scene between bilbo and smaug is a masterpiece. I would just add that seeing Smaug in the movie theather for the first time was an incredible experience. 

\- Thorin's descent into madness is masterful, Richard Armitage gives his best, all the little moments between Thorin and Bilbo, especially the Acorn one, are splendid and give a lot of heart to the film 

\-I also add that, the remaster in 4k ultra hd, elevates, (at main points), the visual level of these films, especially the battle of the five armies.

All these things I've listed above are some of the best scenes I have ever seen in a fantasy movie, that's the the reason why I would be really grateful if Peter Jackson does a re-edit to bring the relationship between bilbo and thorin back to the center, perhaps at the expense of some action scenes or some secondary plots, and I think it would be easy to do, I'm not talking about reshoots or rewrites, because what is needed is already in the movies, also working on a re-edit would not cost much in terms of money. I am nobody, and I know that Peter Jackson is probably tired of working on this saga, and maybe he couldn't do it, if Warner Bros does not agree, but at least from my point of view, it is as if he had stopped two meters away from the finish line, because yes, hobbit films are good films, but I am deeply convinced that they can be exceptional films with a simple re-edit, and perhaps for him it would also be ""therapeutic"" to improve his trilogy.

Here is the link to my petition, which is not meant to be a way to force Warner or Peter Jackson, also because if I were sure that he is the first not to want to do such a thing, I would not do this post either. This petition is just a way to show fans' interest in such an operation, and I hope you will be at my side. I conclude by thanking Sir Peter Jackson for all his wonderful films that have raised and influenced me so much. 

Ps: I know what many of you are going to tell me, look at the fanedits, but the fact is that I have an ethical problem with the fanedits, as I would like the official version of the director. 

Pps: There is always hope

TheHobbit,Does the 4k ultra hd improve the battle of the five armies?," Hello everybody, for those of you who bought the 4k ultra hd version of the hobbit, i'm curious to know if the battle of the 5 armies has improved visually. I didn't find many scenes on youtube, but the few I saw impressed me, much more colorful, some significantly improved cgi parts (like bard lashing out at the troll), and in general the coldness of digital seems very reduced to me. , can you confirm it?

TheHobbit,"I really need Peter Jackson to do a re-edit of the hobbit trilogy, will It never happen?","I really need peter jacskon to do a re-edit of the hobbit trilogy, i mean, it's clear that there are great movies hidden in that trilogy, but it's all so watered down, this saddens me a lot, because the core of the film is exceptional . I know what some of you are going to tell me: watch the fanedit, and I did. I even did a fanedit of my own, and it satisfied me a lot but ... I have a problem, I find it hard to accept the ethical issue at the base of fanedit, I want the director's vision, it's my limit. 

This thing does not give me peace, because it is obvious that a re-edit that cuts the grease and many useless parts in cgi, can make the hobbit something wonderful. 

Also, if Jackson does such a thing, not only us fans who already noticed it with fanedits, but anyone could realize all the good he did with those movies 

Also, I don't understand why peter jackson doesn't want to reassemble his trilogy, I mean, he is a great professional, how can he not realize that a new editing is necessary? Part of me is under the illusion that this will happen with the new edition that will be released this summer, but it probably won't. Don't you think it would be something that would please everyone? fans would finally have superior movies to enjoy, warner would make money, so do you think it will happen sooner or later? or do you think warner would oppose to a new editing? or maybe Jackson is not interested in improving his work? (although it proved otherwise with the 4k ultra hd version)."

TheHobbit,I Think there are two amazing movies hidden in the hobbit trilogy,"First of all I am italian, so If I make some language mistake, forgive me. I'd like to talk about a movie that to me is unique: the hobbit. Why I consider that trilogy unique? Because it contains some very bad scenes, like legolas jumping everywhere, but at the same time, that trilogy has some of the best scene I ever seen in a fantasy movie, and I am not exagerating. I consider Peter Jackson an incredible director, and I deeply love all his work on the main story of the hobbit trilogy from start (erebor's prologue), to finish (with the exception of beorn, I think he doesn't add nothing to the plot). 
The cgi in the main story is really good, for example of you pause the movie at Goblin town, you can see how each Goblin has differents features, it's just incredibile.
I even like azog's design and animation, and smaug It's the best dragon in the history of cinema. The bad scenes in terms of cgi and writing, to me, are mainly in the secondary storylines, like tauriel, dol goldur, alfred and some useless action scenes, but I ask you this, once you remove that bad scenes, what remains? It remains an extremely well directed movie, a direction that is far above the blockbuster average, with great writing and interpretations, It remains the story of bilbo and thorin, their friendship, (they are my favourites character of the entire saga, and freeman and armitage are simply fabolous). It remains a coerhent story. The dwarfs are perfects, each one of the has a unique style and interpretation, and many of them are deepened: thorin, balin, bofur, but also dwalin and kili, (the scene where kili rebels against thorin always give me chills, what a delivery from aidan turner). For those saying that all the dwarfes should have been deepened, it was't possible, because if you give ten minutes of talking at each dwarf, you take 130 minutes away from the movies, but they are very functional as a group (as in the book), the visual characterization the Jackson gave them is incredible, and you know why many people complained the they wanted to see them more? Because Jackson made them charismatic, and I assure you, with other directors, (and I am not referring  to del Toro, whom I love as much as Jackson), we would have had much more anonymous dwarves, instead we had balin, bofur and thorin, I appreciate them as much if not more than gimli. 
But the fact is: I don't understand why Jackson, after making something that I consider almost at the same level of lotr (even if, for me, nothing can reach the fellowship of the ring), he weakened it with some very bad and useless scenes and secondary plots. This is the reason I re-edited the trilogy in two movies, the result is amazing, not to my credit, but to jackson and his team. I hope that one day even Jackson will release a two movie cut, so not only me and the hundreds of people on the internet who re-edit the trilogy, but everyone, will see all the good that he made with that movies."
TheHobbit,"Bolg, slayer of love triangles",
TheHobbit,I need an advice for my fanedit,"Hi everyone from Italy, I'm doing a hobbit fanedit which focuses on the main story of bilbo and dwarfs. The reason is that I think Jackson did a great job with the main story, unlike the side additions like tauriel. However, there is one exception: beorn. Honestly it's the only part of the book that Jackson didn't live up to, I mean, I love beorn in the book, but in the movies it's just ... meh, not bad, but not great, and it doesn't seem very necessary to the main storyline (as tom bombadil). For this reason I need your advice, I was thinking of starting the second film with gandalf and the dwarfs on horseback who reach mirkwood, the question is, in your opinion, is it plausible that they have new mounts, or It's a plot hole? I had already thought of starting with the dwarves in mirkwood, but in doing so, it is not clear why Gandalf is not with them, any advice from you is welcome, thank you."
TheHobbit,Looking for beautiful character moments between dwarves and between Bilbo and the dwarves,"From either the theatrical or extended editions of *The Hobbit* movies, please share with me your favorite character moments (no matter how small) between dwarves or between Bilbo and a dwarf.

I created a fanedit (*The Hobbit Abridged*) which I'm now remaking in 4k and surround sound. The current version is a 3-in-1 edit that clocks in at 3h45m. I'm taking this opportunity to put fresh eyes on the project and one thing I'd love to add back in are some little character moments that may have been trimmed for pacing, but add a lot of heart.

I'm rewatching all 3 films in both theatrical and extended to refresh myself. It's been fun so far. But I've mostly needed to do this while working and I know I'm still missing things. **So for fans of the films, what were your favorite character moments?**

I'll start off with an example. Bofur and Bilbo share a scene in the Misty Mountains where Bofur catches Bilbo ""escaping"" to return to Rivendell. (I hated this scene when I first saw it--why the heck would Bilbo rush back out to a bunch of stone giants that almost killed him?? Makes no sense...) But I love how this scene bookends with another, in the extended edition of BotFA, when Bofur catches Bilbo leaving the Lonely Mountain to go take the Arkenstone to the men in Dale. Separated into two movies each scene kind of gets lost, but together they show a lovely growth of Bilbo's character, and a warm relationship built with Bofur."

TheHobbit,My reflection as someone who got into the hobbit,"I thought that the hobbit was an amazing adventure an amazing story.

One of my passions is history and I really loved that these books take influence from The Norse, the Danes, the Saxon, and the Celt cultures I saw Beowulf references all over the place.

I just loved how descriptive the writing was I could invasion everything that is happening.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing I loved about the book was that I related to it quite a bit.

I am a young man of 18 about to graduate high school. I related to Bilbo a lot. you see I've always been like this quiet I don't wanna cause a lot of trouble kid. I've always been that way. My world is very small for most of my life it has always felt like home then school home then school. obviously, I went places but usually by myself which I enjoyed because of the independence but I've always been kind of lonely. To put in perspective the first time I ever really went to a friend's house that wasn't a family friend was when I went to go see my girlfriend for the first time in person for Valentine's day which was nearly almost 3 months ago. ( we kept our relationship secret for a bit and we go to different schools) It's not that like I was ever allowed to not go to friends and invite them it's just that I'm not that very courageous to a lot of people it seems like it but I'm not. I struggle with self-esteem and loneliness a lot. To combat this I like to fill the void with stories and movies and I love to analyst them. I love stories and games that take me places. Where was I right Bilbo. the reason I relate to Bilbo is that like in the beginning of the book I feel for the most part like content with my life even though I feel it's boring and simple and I have severe FOMO. I always yearn for independence and adventure.  I want that adventure but I'm afraid to take it In a way much like Bilbo I'm about to be forced into an adventure after my senior exams. I guess also things are starting to look up as im finally learning how to drive. Though I do not know what I'm going to do with my life yet I'm taking a year to hopefully figure it out. While I'm in the workforce, I hope to finally do things that I would like to do on my own when I want. That's one of the biggest reasons I really liked this book is that Bilbo really connected with me I could really relate 

&amp;#x200B;

Next on the agenda is what will I do now.

So as for the movies one of the reasons that I read the book in the first place was to watch the movies. I was lucky in February to catch a screening of the fellowship of the ring in IMAX for the 20th anniversary. I really enjoyed it so much so I thought I might as well give the books a proper chance.

So I will be watching the movies

I will be starting with Peter Jackson's an unexpected Journey and 1977 animated The Hobbit.

Then I will watch the other two.

My reviews for those will be posted to my tik tok  moviesandsometimesgames

&amp;#x200B;

Now as for my next read The fellowship of the Ring I'm hoping to get that started this weekend by either purchasing a copy from my local book or if its gonna be cheaper cause I like to conserve money imma order a copy but I can read chapter one because my copy of the hobbit comes with the first chapter of the fellowship of the Ring.  These will be posted on the LOTR subreddit because I like organization 

I thank you all for your time and thank you for encouraging me on this Journey there and back again"
TheHobbit,My thoughts on chapter 19 as someone who got into the hobbit.," Chapter 19 is just so satisfying you can really feel how much Bilbo feels he's changed and hasn't changed.

You can feel his satisfaction and the happiness that Gandalf and Balin felt for him.

 Speaking of Gandalf Did Tolkien ever write a book about Gandalf and the other wizards fighting the Necromancer because that would be very interesting to see. 

I shall have my final thoughts and what will happen to this series going forward in about 30 mins to an hour.

Thank you all for coming with me on this journey to the lonely mountain."
TheHobbit,My thoughts on Chapters 17 and 18 as some just getting into the Hobbit.,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The Clouds Burst Chapter 17

I think I said this when The party was battling the wargs in the misty mountains.

But a lot of the things that are written in the Battle of the Five Armies are some of the stuff id expect Peter Jackson to do.

I can vividly see the battle at such a great scale All the races at each others throat coming together to defeat a common enemy 

That being said Gandalf at random telling everyone to unite cause the goblins are coming felt a little awkward, to be honest, I don't know why. 

With that, I guess it was foreshadowed considering how it is made clear that Smaug is dead.

Speaking of that I'm actually quite happy with the fact that Smaug is built up so much as the biggest obstacle in the journey yet it was like greed, emotions that were in the way.

&amp;#x200B;

18: The Return Journey

The first few pages are really sad but satisfying.

I loved the conversation between Thorin and Bilbo I really do and I hold it up there with some of the most iconic exchanges in any form of media. Like its up there with Marion and Norman speaking the parlor in Psycho. It's up there with like Vince and Jules shooting the shit in Pulp fiction its just I really loved it even though how sad it is.,

I love it when Bilbo doubts his efforts Thorin right before his spirit went to the halls of the lonely mountain tells Bilbo how wrong and how important he is. It also felt like it gave Thorin a Chance to reflect on himself I felt. 

I loved the retelling of Beorn's involvement in the battle.

I loved how Dain Gave a gift to the Wood elf king.

I loved how Bilbo gave a gift.

I loved how everything seems to recap.

&amp;#x200B;

Now if you excuse me I have one more chapter and a reflection to write eventually tonight so stay tuned."

TheHobbit,Better fan edit of The Hobbit than Maple Films?,"I don't see any recent topics, so I apologize for a duplicate post if it's there.

I'm looking for a good fan edit that's more accurate to the book. Right now, the fan edit I watch is the Maple Films fan edit. However, it has its issues and I'm wondering if any do it better. Here are the big issues I have with the Maple Films version:

1. I wish the Eagle rescue of the dwarves from the Wargs was edited to not include Gandalf using the moth to summon them.
2. The Beorn introduction from the EE should have been included
3. Some of the Smaug stuff could have been trimmed. Also, I've seen clips from other fanedits where Smaug looks fine coming out of the mountain (in this one, he's still dripping metal, they just made it not gold). Also, I've seen a clip from another fanedit where Bard's son is totally removed from the death scene.
4. I know this would be hard, but hopefully make it so Thorin doesn't mysteriously have Orcrist back when fighting Bolg.

I've also been looking at a another fan edit that tries to restore the trilogy to it's original two film format. While interesting as a curiosity, I still feel most of the White Council stuff just doesn't work. I especially can't reconcile how powerful the wraiths are in this film with how they later appear in *LOTR*.

Do any other book fan edits improve any of the issues listed above?

Thank you for you help."

TheHobbit,My thoughts on Chapter 16 as someone just getting into the Hobbit,"
My man Bilbo being a heroic Bamf!


Firstly he helps out our big boy Bombur get some sleep  so Bilbo  give yourself a pat on the Back


Also Bilbo attempting the least violent route of dealing with the Thorin being an arrogant greedy ass is worth another pat on the back.


With that Bilbo is also loyal. 

Loyal not to Thorin or Erebor but he‚Äôs loyal and cares about his friends the other dwarves 



That is a nice Classical Hero thing I like."
TheHobbit,My thoughts on Chapters 14 and 15 as someone getting into the Hobbit,"
14: Fire and Water


Damn was this badass and a great way to set up conflict.


The vivid description of Smaug‚Äôs desolation and destruction was both amazing and  a little terrifying.

I do like Bard killing the dragon.

I also  like the set up for conflict.


Cause now laketown and what ever kingdom it is like like in shambles both from a political and the fact that half of the village is destroyed.

People are tired and hungry and it really sets up the conflict for the next chapter.


15: The gathering of The clouds 


So Bard is a hero people are questioning there leader yay!

But oh no everyone  knows that Smaug is dead.

And a town is destroyed fuck!


So I really loved the birds it was both funny and very interesting 


But Thoren Oh my fucking god your being a real prick!


It‚Äôs like there is so much gold!

It probably takes way more gold than the 14 of you would ever need for a dragon to sleep on top of it.

Poor fucking bilbo offered to give up his share in order for there to be no war.

Now the elves are invoked oooo god damn you greedy basterd!"
TheHobbit,Hello there !!! Any Simmers here recreating middle earth and the Misty Mountain on the sims 4 ?,
TheHobbit,Just watched the Hobbit by Rankin-Bass for the first time last night...,"And man, was it ever good!  I was pleasantly surprised.   I love the depiction of Bilbo and Gollum in particular.  Those of whom have seen it, did you find it missed the mark on anything?  While I haven't read the Hobbit in many years, I did notice Beorn was not included, but aside from that I *think* they covered most everything..

I may not share this opinion with everyone but I officially like it better than PJ's The Hobbit.  Comparatively, PJ's was just oversaturated with filler (among other nuances) whereas RB's was just enough.  

I also have RB's RotK and Bakshi's LotR left to watch.  I'll probably watch Bakshi's LotR next even though it's not likely to transition completely seamlessly, then finish with RB's RotK.

What do you think of all this?"

If so please do share it with me!!"
TheHobbit,What do you think happened to Tauriel ?,"People who care about the movies, what do you think Tauriel did after the Battle of the Five Armies ? Do you think she'd go back into the service of Thranduil like before after what happened ? Or would she go somewhere else ?
Give me your ideas, headcanons, etc. If anyone liked Tauriel but not her love biz with Kili, it's a chance to give me your headcanons too.

Also, she's a wood Elf, so she's not sailing West in theory."
TheHobbit,My thoughts on Chapter 13 as someone getting into the hobbit,"I‚Äôm wondering why Bilbo is hiding the Arkenstone.

I‚Äôm wondering because what if it is the only thing that is able to kill Smaug and then Bilbo pulls it out then Thoren sees it and like Bilbos relationships are shattered.

Speaking of the mighty Oaken shield I do like how this chapter gave him more emotion that isn‚Äôt like serious. Particularly when he orders the dwarves to immediately to help Bilbo and then when everyone is chilling outside of the cave Thoren is like joking being like Don‚Äôt call my kingdom a shit hole it just needs a lol dusting.

I am curious though how SMaug will be defeated if even.

I have a few thoughts 


One what I remember from the movie.

In the movie I remember that it‚Äôs like they melt the gold then pour it onto Smaug.


Two: They don‚Äôt have the Dragon born but Bilbo gets that armor so maybe it‚Äôs dragon proof. Or maybe Bilbo will get some of the super strength that Sauron had when he wore the ring.


3: so like all these different races come together for like a avengers type battle. The Wood Elf‚Äôs, The goblins and there Wargs. The lake men Gandalf comes back maybe the Eagle kingdom.

Maybe any like other remaining dwarfs that are also on a quest for the kingdom.


I‚Äôm very excited I‚Äôm trying to finish the book so I can watch the movie because even it is bad I would like to see a visual representation of these characters that Have really grown on me and I relate to.


It‚Äôs the kinda same feeling I had when I watched the Gatsby movie."

TheHobbit,My thoughts on chapters 10 11 and 12 as someone who is just getting into the hobbit.,"
10. A warm welcome.

Umm I haven‚Äôt gotten much to say on this chapter.

Like I like the idea of the lake town.

I will say I do wonder if the Wood Elves are gonna try and enact revenge on our unexpected  party.



11. On the doorstep.


I feel like on  the Doorstep is the most Skyrim this book has gotten in the sense that unless you can fast travel I just find it hilarious the dwarves having to constantly go up and down the pathway in the Lonely Mountain.


12. inside information.

So before I started reading the hobbit I looked up the book and realized there‚Äôs only one book.

I felt puzzled by this as there are 3 movies.

How do you divide a book into three movies?

Granted I haven‚Äôt watched any of the movies in about 10 years but that seems just as stupid as attempting to tell the story of Starwars in 1 movie.


Like the Lord of the Rings trilogy makes sense.

There is the fellowship of the Ring

The Two Towers

The return of the king.


One movie per book.

But anyway you know on google unseen the link to the website there‚Äôs lil preview in that areas.

Any way the area said  and I‚Äôm paraphrasing 

‚ÄúJackson thought that Smaug wasn‚Äôt menacing enough so they added his back story‚Äù


So Um Peter you obviously didn‚Äôt read this chapter cause damn this Dragon is smart as fuck!


If you go back to earlier in the book Thoren is telling this emotional story about how dangerous deadly Smaug is.

Also I love how the narrator talks to the reading like a tutorial like they‚Äôre like Bilbo didn‚Äôt know dragon. Speak. Dragon speak is dangerous and manipulative.

Like if you were planning a vacation to the lonely mountain.


Smaug is meanacing as well.
I do like how Bilbo has on the ring and talks shit meanwhile Smaug doesn‚Äôt recognize his smell really honing in that the hobbits don‚Äôt do shit outside the Shire.


Smaug is one of my favorite types of villains it seems he‚Äôs kinda like Hans Landa in the sense that he knows how to use words to get whomever he‚Äôs talking to say either what he needs to know or what he wants to hear. That being said he‚Äôs got a bit of an Ego.


Also I love the Bromance that we got with Balin and Bilbo it‚Äôs nice it‚Äôs fun Balin really seems to respect Bilbo the most.

Anyway there is your triple feature."

Every Monday - Friday from 7:00 - 8:15 AM CST (12:00-13:15 GMT) until I have finished I will be reading for 15-20 minutes from The Hobbit and then I will be playing through Lego: The Hobbit.  It is completely free to come hang out and enjoy the story and the game.  I keep the stream family appropriate, and kindly ask that you would do the same in the chat.

It would be an honor to have people come by and share their Tolkien and Middle Earth Knowledge.  I am no expert and would love if you wanted to help me, and others, understand this masterpiece on a deeper level.   We have some fun sound effects from the movies and I am also welcome to any other ideas that people may have to make the stream more engaging.  I also have a replica Sting sword and that's cool.

TheHobbit,My thoughts on chapters 8 and 9 as someone just getting into the hobbit.,"
Chapters 8 Flies and spiders.

So the spiders I really liked I also liked how there are intelligent and can speak.

I like this chapter for the same reasons I liked Riddles in the Dark in that Bilbo is practically on his own but the stakes are raised cause he has to save the party.

Also Bilbo fucking with the spiders funny as hell.



Chapter 9 Barrels out of bond.


So barrels out of bond is a nice lil prison escape fiasco and I love it.

Also I just found it funny how thorin goes there by himself and refuses to tell them why there there then the king is like

YOUR GOING IN A TIME OUT.

But also like in Riddles and Flies and spiders Bilbo is still kinda on his own it‚Äôs up to him to plan and wait it out to free the dwarves."

I finally got around to watching this series, and the payoff of that final fight was so much more than mere icing on the cake; it was, in my opinion, the single best 1v1 fight scene I've ever witnessed in the context of fantasy cinema. When Thorin's blade pushes through Azog, and we see it come through the ice, and we know the Thorin himself has received a mortal wound... I practically left my body with the dramatic impact that was fully delivered to my nervous system in such fantastic fashion. 

Kudos to the filmmaker and actors and everyone involved for creating this wonderful spectacle of passion and violence."

I am watching the Hobbit Trilogy for the first time and will watch the LOTR trilogy after these.
I have just watched the first two movies extended versions and loved them.
I normally never give 10/10 to a movie except those like Shawshank Redemption.
I gave Hobbit 1 9/10 and am thinking of giving the Desolation of Smaug 10/10.
Am I being too generous or what? 
I wasn't expecting to like them this much especially after seeing the bad reviews."
TheHobbit,What should I watch first? The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings? (No spoilers please),"I want to get into the Middleearth-Franchise and started by reading The Hobbit, as recommended in an older post rather than starting with The Lord of the Rings.

But I am unsure wether I can without spoilers for LotR. I've seen the trailer for the first Hobbit movie and saw some scenes I don't recall even though reading the book the last days.

TheHobbit,My thoughts on Chapters 5 and 6 as someone just getting into the Hobbit.,"Had the Chance to read two chapters in class today.  


So to start I'm just wondering. I do know for a fact that the Lord of the Rings was originally supposed to be a direct sequel to the Hobbit but was expanded into a larger work.  
That got me thinking about the Necromancer of Mirkwood that was mentioned in the early chapters.  
So is the Necromancer like beta Sauron like a Sauron that is rebuilding his strength? Also does the Necromancer come back and play a major role in the story. (Just answer with Yes or no plz.)  


Chapter V: Riddles in the Dark 

So the reason I really like this chapter is that Bilbo Baggins is on his own.

Gandalf can't help him and neither can Thorin or the other dwarves.

Bilbo is forced to rely on only himself to be safe. Granted he has the ring but the majority of the Chapter is him screwing with Gollum with the riddles and questions.

Also Gollum my guy why you gonna go try and eat Bilbo? I watched the two towers you literally pull a fish out of the water beat it to death and eat it raw to the dust of Sam and Frodo.

Chapter VI: Out of the frying pan and into the fire.

I know I went on about how detailed the writing is but holy shit! How vivid was this chapter like the whole fight scene is literally something id expect Peter Jackson to put in there!!! It is amazing how descriptive it is. 

I love how Gandalf just unintentionally sets the forest on fire. Then the Eagles are all like it's those fuckin wolves again then there like those mammals set the damn forest on fire.... but they killed the wolfs better go save them.   
 Then eagle kings like yeah'll take you for a ride but I can only go this far and Gandalf is like fine thank, you kind sirs.  


The image of the Eagles having these interactions in my head just make me laugh in my mind there like the bird people from Zelda pretty much.

  
Also, the image of all these Dwarves and the Hobbit trying to all climb the tree is funny.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking on Dwarves umm Dori needs to like stop being a whiney dick. Like yeah everyone knows a Goblin tripped you its not your fault that you dropped Bilbo but like man stop being so Salty.

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho there goes your double feature for today. Imma go have an elevensies!!!!!"

TheHobbit,A Podcast Review of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey!,"Hello Hobbits!

A friend and I recently started a Podcast called [Rival Reviews](https://rival-reviews.pinecast.co/) where we review/discuss/debate different movies. We're both huge Tolkien fans, so we made sure An Unexpected Journey was one of our first movies we talked about. We really enjoyed discussing and debating it and always have fun challenging each other's opinions and we're really curious about the opinions of other fans on the film and our podcast itself.

TheHobbit,I've made a video which is aimed to help in the lecture the book of The Hobbit.,"I am a non native English speaker who enjoys reading. These are the annotations that I use when going through the book. They are basically word definitions. Notice that:   

Every page is spaced 30 seconds except the two first at the beginning those are approximately 10s and the last one which is around 15s.  

Words choice is arbitrary. 

Words can be repeated in order to help in their memorization. 

Images help to comprehend a definition.

The first chapter published is chapter V, also arbitrarily."
TheHobbit,My thoughts on Chapter 4 as someone just getting into the Hobbit.,"Chapter 4 is a nice action pack lil chapter.

Now when I was in elementary school and watched the movie this is one scene I vividly remember the Goblin mines. It actually made me laugh my ass off cause the Goblin King is like what are youse gon do? Then Gandalf Guts him like a fish.


Back to the book.

I do love how the Goblins immediately call bullshit after thorin is like. ‚ÄúYeah we‚Äôre visiting me aunts a uncles and Cousins‚Äù

The mountain does seem like a dangerous place though like they really highlight that. Kinda reminds me of like any cave in Skyrim. (I wonders if they got any Hobbit mods for Skyrim)

I'm just gonna leave my opinion here and say that I believe it was an unbelievably underrated scene because without a word Gandalf was checking to see if bilbo was indeed the same person he was back in the shire despite what hes been through and thus proving Gandalf right...that it's not so much great power and strength that overcome evil but the good deeds of common everyday folk that keeps the evil at bay...beautiful 
Also I'd like to add that this could have been all Gandalf needed to know going into the lord of the rings and that he knew frodo would be the only one capable of carrying the ring without being corrupted"

TheHobbit,My thoughts on Chapter 3 as someone just getting into the hobbit,"So to start once again just amazed at how detailed that Tolkien wrote for the environments like you can vividly picture these caves, trees, bilbo falling asleep on the pony.


This is a more personal note but I often laugh at myself like how my mind pictures the events and characters in the book like it‚Äôs half animated half real life.
Like 
Bilbo, Gandalf and Elrond all appear as Martin Freeman, Ian Mckellen, and Hugo Weaving.

The Dwarfs they all look like those stereo typical like garden gnomes but with like clothes and crossbows or sometimes there just like smurfs in my head

Like something like this [what I‚Äôm talking about ](https://images.app.goo.gl/ZfGTQJuhAbvXLePN6)


Then like the elves that were singing kinda just appeared like pearl from Steven universe 


Also speaking of the singing elves there‚Äôs a certain word in there lil song that I‚Äôm surprised is still In the copy of the book I‚Äôm reading (I‚Äôm reading the movie tie in paper back) 
Like I‚Äôm no upset or anything I just find it interesting which Also I‚Äôm not werided out I‚Äôve heard the word a million times around Christmas in a non Malice context cause my dads from Ireland  and there‚Äôs this old Dublin Christmas song that has the word in its chorus.

But I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs kept in the book cause I rather read it in its traditional authentic writing.

But nice lil 15 min chapter."

TheHobbit,My thoughts on Chapter 2 as someone just getting into the hobbit,"So I can‚Äôt not think that the Trolls are a reference to the cyclops in the Odyssey or at least inspired there part in the book.

I do find it funny that Bilbo is both regretting coming and also trying to be a burglar.

Also I listen to audiobooks while I‚Äôm reading so I get the full scope. They gave the trolls this cockney accent and I love it üòÇüòÇ


Now here is something I forgot to mention in my thoughts on chapter 1

TheHobbit,How to choose the right Hobbit cut?,"As a kid, I was read to before going to sleep. One of the books was The Hobbit. When the first movie came out I was in 2nd or 4th grade. I liked them and didn't understand the people who disliked them. Of course, now I want to revisit the movies with my family, as they also felt that the Hobbit was bland, and I don't know which cut to choose. I rewatched the movies and I see how one can get bored of them because I did. I have watched the Tolkien edit and it was ok, but it was a bit meh. I have Cardinal cut now and I don't like the weird cuts with the combat and the exclusion of a lot of fight scenes, but I found out about M4 and Maple studio and those seem very good, but I don't know which to pick. I don't want to watch another 2 4-hour movies as it would just ruin it while watching with my family. So any suggestion for a Hobbit cut?"
TheHobbit,Can we all just take a moment to appreciate Radagast?,
TheHobbit,My thoughts on Chapter one as someone just getting into the Hobbit,"I honestly was amazed at how descriptive each paragraph was. It‚Äôs was almost like a vivid movie scene like I could make it out of legos or in Minecraft or something.

TheHobbit,Finally saw the extended versions!,"I recently decided to finally get the extended Hobbit trilogy on Blu-Ray after holding off for years.  I‚Äôve had LotR extended for years, and I never disliked the Hobbit ones, but never quite felt the need to get them.  Well...I finally have, and I think they‚Äôre all improved in their extended versions!  Some thoughts (minor spoilers):

- Lots of good added stuff in the first two movies.  Some of it is definitely bloat, but I appreciated more of the lore.  More of Mirkwood in the second one is a huge plus.

- I enjoyed the new little plot line about the Dwarf rings, Thrain, and the little mention of Gandalf‚Äôs ring.  But I also don‚Äôt feel it exactly led anywhere, and that thread is not really taken up in the LotR movies.

- The third movie I found to be SIGNIFICANTLY better than its theatrical version.  Lots of the added scenes are just battle sequences, but they had a lot of great moments for pretty much each dwarf.  Brings about a lot of closure for them.  Most of those scenes were completely cut from the theatrical.

- The third film in its theatrical form always felt sort of abrupt and perfunctory to me, and the extended went a long way to improve on it.  It blows my mind that in theaters we never saw resolution to the Arkenstone, Alfrid, Thorin‚Äôs funeral, and Dain‚Äôs coronation.  I feel they took the criticism of RotK having too many endings, and massively overcorrected to give TBotFA not enough.  Still, I was thrilled to see the extended version give appropriate closure.

All in all, very happy I bought.  Liked them more than I remember, and they flow better with LotR than I thought they would.  Definitely looking forward to some good 6-movie marathons."

TheHobbit,The Moria and Iron Hills Dwarves' hammers.,"You can see them very clearly here on the the GW models: [https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Grim-Hammers-2018](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Grim-Hammers-2018)

For one, the aesthetic of the armour is like cut diamonds, angular and showing off the great skill of the craftsman and the way it ties boars into the design.

However the hammers are the icing on the cake. In most fantasy, warhammers are huge chunks of metal, too hefty for a human (though a dwarf I'm sure would have little problem) and generally unwieldy. Techniqually these should be labelled as mauls and mallets. Throughout history, true 'war-hammers' are much smaller, far more similar to the ones that the Dwarves hold in the films. They are just big enough to be able to hold and feature the characteristics of historical examples, such as crow beak spikes.

Slightly off the topic of the title, but however much I dislike that the Dwarves use swords, those they use are actually based off of historical examples. They are called seaxes (seax singular) and are Scandinavian (used by those on a Viking) daggers. In the hobbit we see larger versions wielded by the Moria Dwarves and Fili.

We can see all these weapons in the battle of moria [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olVsFS8Ajtk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olVsFS8Ajtk). (as a side note they unfortunately use metal shields, which are rather impractical.)

Here is a another picture of the hammers from the concept art. this one has a sort of spade/pick axe beak on the back side. Compared to a replica of a historical hammer, it is incredibly accurate, down to the front head not being flat, instead having sort of spikes a bit like a potato masher.

TheHobbit,What did the Mayor want to say in the 3rd movie?,"I've rewarched the third movie a few days ago and noticed a small scene where the mayor and alfrid have a short conversation. 

They're sitting in the boat during smaugs attack. 


Mayor: ""If we could only take more of these poor people with us, but they're hardly-""

He gets interrupted by Alfrid

Alfrid: ""Worth it, I agree""

Mayor: ""What?""

And then Aldrid pushes away that one person clinging to the boat. 


Now I'm wondering what he meant to say. 
I've always seen him as a very unlikable character but after noticing that he cares at least a bit about his people changes my mind a little. 
But of course it depends on what he actually wanted to say. 

What do you think? Or is there an explanation somewhere?

TheHobbit,Silmarillion Study Ideas,"So I‚Äôve been thinking about documenting and studying my next read through of The Silmarillion - now I‚Äôm on my 3rd read through, I‚Äôd like to try and get to grips with it a bit more and understand more of who did what, when they did it, who else was around at the time, where it was etc

I was thinking of buying 5 or 6 notebooks - one for each race (Valar, maiar, elves, men, dwarves) and maybe one for a timeline.

Each race notebook could have a list of names/characters per page and their parents, siblings, relations etc and then big events of their life etc The Valar could be the same but with a list of which Maia ‚Äòbelong‚Äô to that Valar.

Timeline would obviously be like 1/10/100 years per page and then a list of stuff.

What do you guys think? What would you assign each notebook to? What else would you add and consider noting during a Silmarillion read through?

Would be really interested to see if any of you have done this and how you got on/what you‚Äôd recommend to do!

Thanks!"

TheHobbit,The long defeat,"I saw a few days back that someone posted about Boromir, and relating to his character in their own life. I think it was on r/tolkienfans, and not on the r/lordoftherings subreddit. I would normally resist real life comparisons, sharing Tolkien's wariness of allegory and of reading too much into something an author has written, but I appreciated that post for its honesty, and I could entirely see where they were coming from.

I'm currently re-reading The Lord of the Rings having not read it for over 10 years (I was a pretty obsessed teen and consumed anything Tolkien-related that I could), and I'm finding poignancy in sentiments that, similarly to the person who posted about the relatable aspects of Boromir, echo patterns in my own.

I study and now work in the human rights legal/political sphere. I'm not posting this to throw politics in peoples' faces, but simply to express my own gleaning from the books - what makes LOTR so potent when you read it from a certain reader's personal perspective. Others will get different things from it.

I posted this passage a few days ago:

‚ÄúThere, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tower high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and **hope returned to him**. For like a shaft, clear and cold, **the thought pierced him that in the end, the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach.**‚Äù¬†

I would also post these alongside it as some of my personal favourite book moments:

""The eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken, but about the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold. A trailing plant with flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if in reverence for the fallen king, and in the crevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed.**'They cannot conquer for ever!'** said Frodo. And then suddenly the brief glimpse was gone. The Sun dipped and vanished, and as if at the shuttering of a lamp, black night fell.""

and

""For the Lord of the Galadrim is accounted the wisest of the Elves of Middle-earth, and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings. He has dwelt in the West since the days of dawn, and I have dwelt with him years uncounted; for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the mountains, and **together through ages of the world we have fought the long defeat.**""

I won't delve too deeply into the philosophy or complexity of whatever moral takes are to be credibly taken from Tolkien's works. I'm simply trying to clumsily express my own response to it in the stage I am in my own life.

Despite being a student of politics, and mature enough to recognise the muddiness and complexity of geopolitics and adult life, I am finding that there is something extremely poignant for me in some of these elegant, and often simple, sentiments in Tolkien's works. There is something so powerful about the notion of a ""**long defeat**"", and about the notion that in a truly dark moment, you get a glimpse of hope or light, and about the defiance of the sentiment that nothing truly evil can endure for long. A fellow redditor commented a week or so back about the line ‚Äú**Oft** ***evil*** **will shall** ***evil mar***‚Äù, which also kind of chimes with that.

As someone who has studied and now works in progressive political legal spheres around human rights and so on, the ""long defeat"" feels extremely familiar, and thus, validating. It's validating not just for those who work to protect and uplift those who are victims of the indifference or active oppression of the state, or of discrimination of other forms, but particularly for those are marginalised themselves - the justifiable hopelessness of feeling that whatever progress is made is at a snail's pace/two steps forward one step back (or 3 steps back!). This notion that you fight for many, many years against a form of ""darkness"" only to never truly be victorious is such a wonderful and compelling aspect of the books. Through working in a field where you are using legal frameworks to protect marginalised or oppressed people against the worst impulses of the state, and frankly the worst impulses of bigoted or wilfully ignorant individual human beings, you're never ultimately victorious. Your job is never done, the ""wounds"" are never ""wholly cured."" It's kind of an eternal watchfulness with no ultimate guarantee of anything, with uncertainty often feeling like a drain or a weight on you. It's exhausting, wearisome to toil and to make what are often morally easily-understood and uncontentious arguments in the face of eager dismissal, sabotage, and/or character assassination. I found real parallels in that book concept.

That being said, I also found real hopefulness in Frodo's defiant remark upon seeing the fallen statue head's crown of flowers in the sunlight, even if it was fleeting, and Sam's glimpse of stars in the Mordor, even for a moment. Sometimes, whether overly romantic, or too idealistic perhaps, you need that sense that darkness won't always hold sway. It doesn't have to be politics. It can be bullies in school, an abusive parent or partner, an awful boss, etc., But, I find real value in being reminded of some of these sentiments expressed by Tolkien so well. They're achingly beautiful passages as prose alone, and all the more effective for what they're saying within a generally wonderful book.

You may be a raging Tory or Republican, and take great issue with what I've written, but I don't think I'm being completely outrageous in gleaning this from the book for my own purposes. I wish I could articulate this better, but I wanted to get it down, and see if anyone else has a sense of what i'm getting at in far too many words. You're very welcome to berate me for being cheesy or overly political/idealistic, or to simply disagree with me vigorously. I can handle constructive criticism, but please don't make it smarmy or personal attacks.

\* I'll make a few little additions.

In the Hobbit, towards the end, Bilbo says ""**So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending**!""

Back to The Lord of the Rings, though, the chapter of the Scouring of the Shire is equally poignant because without it, the ending and the general themes of the book are found lacking. The fact that the ""**very last stroke**"" of the war of the ring falls at Bag End is not a minor detail. It chimes with the very central theme of the book surrounding unlikely heroes, and the sheltered people of the shire not being able to escape the evil that threatens Middle Earth. 

I'm currently at The Voice of Saruman in my re-read and recording of an audiobook, but there is also:

""'But,' said Sam, and tears started in his eyes, 'I thought you were going to enjoy the Shire, too, for years and years, after all you have done.''So I thought too, once. But **I have been too deeply hurt, Sam**. I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but **not for me**. **It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them.** But you are my heir: all that I had and might have had I leave to you. And also you have Rose, and Elanor; and Frodo-lad will come, and Rosie-lass, and Merry, and Goldilocks, and Pippin; and perhaps more that I cannot see. Your hands and your wits will be needed everywhere. You will be the Mayor, of course, as long as you want to be, and the most famous gardener in history; **and you will read things out of the Red Book, and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone, so that people will remember the Great Danger, and so love their beloved land all the more.** And that will keep you as busy and as happy as anyone can be, as long as your part in the Story goes on.

(That little monologue from Frodo is probably my favourite bit from the whole book (N.B. beautifully done by Ian Holm as Frodo in the 1981 BBC Radio play)

and Gildor's line:

‚ÄúThe wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but **you cannot for ever fence it out.**‚Äù

Lastly, a passage from the Prologue about Hobbits:

""The hobbits...**heeded less and less the world outside where dark things moved, until they came to think that peace and plenty were the rule in Middle-Earth and the right of all sensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the Guardians, and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of the Shire.** They were, in fact, **sheltered**, but they had **ceased to remember it**.""

The Shire is not merely an idyllic paradise, or even the land we would and should all seek if evil was purged from the world. It is, in many ways, unhealthy. Tolkien is depicting a complacent, narrow-minded (even in Bree they are ""suspicious...of anything out of the way""), comfortable, yes, but too comfortable land which gives the illusion of the absence of danger, and is as vulnerable to darkness as anywhere else in the end. Moreover, it is thanklessly and silently guarded by others. Bilbo returns from his adventure with Thorin and Co. and never quite fits in from then on. His adventures are ""queer"", and not fitting of a hobbit, or even fabrications to the minds of many hobbits. he's viewed as eccentric and ""cracked"". Likewise, Frodo is wounded, yes, but upon his return (and the return of Pippin, Merry and Sam) their Shire is found largely unaware of the cost of a war that but for Saruman, they would never have been particularly involved with, or seemingly affected by. The four hobbits are profoundly changed, and thus can never really belong in the way the Shire expects of them. That loneliness and feeling out of place is something I can profoundly relate to as well.

These passages echo some of those same sentiments and aspirational qualities to take from the book; Worldliness, engagement with the world and its troubles, empathy for those not like yourself whose lived experience may not be the same, sometimes painful sacrifice, quiet and selfless acts without hope of reward or glory or praise, courage in the face of overwhelming odds, to name a few.

I hope this post offers something to the table :) Forgive me if I don't keep up with every comment in agreement or disagreement."
TheHobbit,The long defeat,"I saw a few days back that someone posted about Boromir, and relating to his character in their own life. I think it was on r/tolkienfans, and not on the r/lordoftherings subreddit. I would normally resist real life comparisons, sharing Tolkien's wariness of allegory and of reading too much into something an author has written, but I appreciated that post for its honesty, and I could entirely see where they were coming from.

I'm currently re-reading The Lord of the Rings having not read it for over 10 years (I was a pretty obsessed teen and consumed anything Tolkien-related that I could), and I'm finding poignancy in sentiments that, similarly to the person who posted about the relatable aspects of Boromir, echo patterns in my own.

I study and now work in the human rights legal/political sphere. I'm not posting this to throw politics in peoples' faces, but simply to express my own gleaning from the books - what makes LOTR so potent when you read it from a certain reader's personal perspective. Others will get different things from it.

I posted this passage a few days ago:

‚ÄúThere, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tower high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and **hope returned to him**. For like a shaft, clear and cold, **the thought pierced him that in the end, the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach.**‚Äù¬†

I would also post these alongside it as some of my personal favourite book moments:

""The eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken, but about the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold. A trailing plant with flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if in reverence for the fallen king, and in the crevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed.**'They cannot conquer for ever!'** said Frodo. And then suddenly the brief glimpse was gone. The Sun dipped and vanished, and as if at the shuttering of a lamp, black night fell.""

and

""For the Lord of the Galadrim is accounted the wisest of the Elves of Middle-earth, and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings. He has dwelt in the West since the days of dawn, and I have dwelt with him years uncounted; for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the mountains, and **together through ages of the world we have fought the long defeat.**""

I won't delve too deeply into the philosophy or complexity of whatever moral takes are to be credibly taken from Tolkien's works. I'm simply trying to clumsily express my own response to it in the stage I am in my own life.

The fact that the ""**very last stroke**"" of the war of the ring falls at Bag End is not a minor detail. It chimes with the very central theme of the book surrounding unlikely heroes, and the sheltered people of the shire not being able to escape the evil that threatens Middle Earth. 

I'm currently at The Voice of Saruman in my re-read and recording of an audiobook, but there is also:

""'But,' said Sam, and tears started in his eyes, 'I thought you were going to enjoy the Shire, too, for years and years, after all you have done.''So I thought too, once. But **I have been too deeply hurt, Sam**. I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but **not for me**. **It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them.** But you are my heir: all that I had and might have had I leave to you. And also you have Rose, and Elanor; and Frodo-lad will come, and Rosie-lass, and Merry, and Goldilocks, and Pippin; and perhaps more that I cannot see. Your hands and your wits will be needed everywhere. You will be the Mayor, of course, as long as you want to be, and the most famous gardener in history; **and you will read things out of the Red Book, and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone, so that people will remember the Great Danger, and so love their beloved land all the more.** And that will keep you as busy and as happy as anyone can be, as long as your part in the Story goes on.

(That little monologue from Frodo is probably my favourite bit from the whole book (N.B. beautifully done by Ian Holm as Frodo in the 1981 BBC Radio play)

and Gildor's line:

‚ÄúThe wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but **you cannot for ever fence it out.**‚Äù

Lastly, a passage from the Prologue about Hobbits:

""The hobbits...**heeded less and less the world outside where dark things moved, until they came to think that peace and plenty were the rule in Middle-Earth and the right of all sensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the Guardians, and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of the Shire.** They were, in fact, **sheltered**, but they had **ceased to remember it**.""

The Shire is not merely an idyllic paradise, or even the land we would and should all seek if evil was purged from the world. It is, in many ways, unhealthy. Tolkien is depicting a complacent, narrow-minded (even in Bree they are ""suspicious...of anything out of the way""), comfortable, yes, but too comfortable land which gives the illusion of the absence of danger, and is as vulnerable to darkness as anywhere else in the end. Moreover, it is thanklessly and silently guarded by others. Bilbo returns from his adventure with Thorin and Co. and never quite fits in from then on. His adventures are ""queer"", and not fitting of a hobbit, or even fabrications to the minds of many hobbits. he's viewed as eccentric and ""cracked"". Likewise, Frodo is wounded, yes, but upon his return (and the return of Pippin, Merry and Sam) their Shire is found largely unaware of the cost of a war that but for Saruman, they would never have been particularly involved with, or seemingly affected by. The four hobbits are profoundly changed, and thus can never really belong in the way the Shire expects of them. That loneliness and feeling out of place is something I can profoundly relate to as well.

These passages echo some of those same sentiments and aspirational qualities to take from the book; Worldliness, engagement with the world and its troubles, empathy for those not like yourself whose lived experience may not be the same, sometimes painful sacrifice, quiet and selfless acts without hope of reward or glory or praise, courage in the face of overwhelming odds, to name a few.

I hope this post offers something to the table :) Forgive me if I don't keep up with every comment in agreement or disagreement."
TheHobbit,The long defeat,"I saw a few days back that someone posted about Boromir, and relating to his character in their own life. I think it was on r/tolkienfans, and not on the r/lordoftherings subreddit. I would normally resist real life comparisons, sharing Tolkien's wariness of allegory and of reading too much into something an author has written, but I appreciated that post for its honesty, and I could entirely see where they were coming from.

I'm currently re-reading The Lord of the Rings having not read it for over 10 years (I was a pretty obsessed teen and consumed anything Tolkien-related that I could), and I'm finding poignancy in sentiments that, similarly to the person who posted about the relatable aspects of Boromir, echo patterns in my own.

I study and now work in the human rights legal/political sphere. I'm not posting this to throw politics in peoples' faces, but simply to express my own gleaning from the books - what makes LOTR so potent when you read it from a certain reader's personal perspective. Others will get different things from it.

I posted this passage a few days ago:

‚ÄúThere, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tower high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and **hope returned to him**. For like a shaft, clear and cold, **the thought pierced him that in the end, the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach.**‚Äù¬†

I would also post these alongside it as some of my personal favourite book moments:

""The eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken, but about the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold. A trailing plant with flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if in reverence for the fallen king, and in the crevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed.**'They cannot conquer for ever!'** said Frodo. And then suddenly the brief glimpse was gone. The Sun dipped and vanished, and as if at the shuttering of a lamp, black night fell.""

and

""For the Lord of the Galadrim is accounted the wisest of the Elves of Middle-earth, and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings. He has dwelt in the West since the days of dawn, and I have dwelt with him years uncounted; for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the mountains, and **together through ages of the world we have fought the long defeat.**""

I won't delve too deeply into the philosophy or complexity of whatever moral takes are to be credibly taken from Tolkien's works. I'm simply trying to clumsily express my own response to it in the stage I am in my own life.

Despite being a student of politics, and mature enough to recognise the muddiness and complexity of geopolitics and adult life, I am finding that there is something extremely poignant for me in some of these elegant, and often simple, sentiments in Tolkien's works. There is something so powerful about the notion of a ""**long defeat**"", and about the notion that in a truly dark moment, you get a glimpse of hope or light, and about the defiance of the sentiment that nothing truly evil can endure for long. A fellow redditor commented a week or so back about the line ‚Äú**Oft** ***evil*** **will shall** ***evil mar***‚Äù, which also kind of chimes with that.

As someone who has studied and now works in progressive political legal spheres around human rights and so on, the ""long defeat"" feels extremely familiar, and thus, validating. It's validating not just for those who work to protect and uplift those who are victims of the indifference or active oppression of the state, or of discrimination of other forms, but particularly for those are marginalised themselves - the justifiable hopelessness of feeling that whatever progress is made is at a snail's pace/two steps forward one step back (or 3 steps back!). This notion that you fight for many, many years against a form of ""darkness"" only to never truly be victorious is such a wonderful and compelling aspect of the books. Through working in a field where you are using legal frameworks to protect marginalised or oppressed people against the worst impulses of the state, and frankly the worst impulses of bigoted or wilfully ignorant individual human beings, you're never ultimately victorious. Your job is never done, the ""wounds"" are never ""wholly cured."" It's kind of an eternal watchfulness with no ultimate guarantee of anything, with uncertainty often feeling like a drain or a weight on you. It's exhausting, wearisome to toil and to make what are often morally easily-understood and uncontentious arguments in the face of eager dismissal, sabotage, and/or character assassination. I found real parallels in that book concept.

That being said, I also found real hopefulness in Frodo's defiant remark upon seeing the fallen statue head's crown of flowers in the sunlight, even if it was fleeting, and Sam's glimpse of stars in the Mordor, even for a moment. Sometimes, whether overly romantic, or too idealistic perhaps, you need that sense that darkness won't always hold sway. It doesn't have to be politics. It can be bullies in school, an abusive partner, an awful boss, etc., an intolerant parent. But, I find real value in being reminded of some of these sentiments expressed by Tolkien so well. They're achingly beautiful passages as prose alone, and all the more effective for what they're saying within a generally wonderful book.

You may be a raging Tory or Republican, and take great issue with what I've written, but I don't think I'm being completely outrageous in gleaning this from the book for my own purposes. I wish I could articulate this better, but I wanted to get it down, and see if anyone else has a sense of what i'm getting at in far too many words. You're very welcome to berate me for being cheesy or overly political/idealistic, or to simply disagree with me vigorously. I can handle constructive criticism, but please don't make it smarmy or personal attacks.

\* I'll make a few little additions.

TheHobbit,Are there any concrete dates for the chapters in the novel?,Title. Time seems to pass pretty arbitrarily.
TheHobbit,Which dwarf got the short end of the stick in the hobbit?,"One thing that's always fascinated me about The Hobbit is how there are *so many* main characters. I mean, honestly, fourteen?? So this time while reading it through I decided to document how many times each dwarf is named because I figured it would be interesting. (Keep in mind this might be a bit off bc I might have missed a couple mentions or smth.)

Dwalin: 21

Balin: 68

Kili: 38

Fili: 51

Dori: 36

Nori: 14

Ori: 11

Oin: 18

Gloin: 22

Bifur: 19

Bofur: 21

Bombur: 59

Thorin: 220

Okay so first things first, no surprise, Thorin takes it by a long shot. It is *Thorin* and Co, after all. Next comes Balin at 68, which makes sense bc he ended up being Bilbo's close friend. Next we have Bombur because he's fat and that got mentioned all the time (especially with things like the boat and the ropes). A close fourth is Fili, with Kili actually pretty far behind him. Funny, I always felt like these two were a package deal but I guess not. Next is Dori because he carried Bilbo through the Goblin tunnels. Coming in 7th is Gloin because he started fires and also argued that Bilbo was useless at the beginning. Bofur and Dwalin are tied for 8th, but they both just kind of exist as filler dwarves. Bifur comes next, then Oin. And finally, in last place, we have Ori, who was only ever really mentioned when they listed all the dwarves. That's rough buddy."

TheHobbit,First time reading The Hobbit (loving it so far) and I made myself a bookmark inspired by the cover of the 2nd impression.,
TheHobbit,"The resemblance between Legolas and Zelda, and Tauriel and Link",
TheHobbit,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug characters compared to The legend of Zelda characters,"I‚Äôm probably not the first and definitely not the only one who see‚Äôs the resemblance between J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs The Hobbit characters: Legolas and Tauriel (created by Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh) and The Legend of Zelda: Link and Zelda. 
People have compared Orlando Bloom‚Äôs character to an older version of link numerous times but I find that he‚Äôs actually seemingly closer to Zelda than link. That would mean Tauriel is more like link instead. Think about it, Legolas and Zelda are both royalty with the flowing blonde hair and a strong sense of free will despite having a commanding king for a father. And Tauriel and Link are the warriors who both wear green and have strong allegiances to their fair counterparts. I think it‚Äôs interesting how both of these pairs have a cross resemblance to each other. I find that amusing. Let me know what you think."

TheHobbit,I‚Äôve been trying to do some detective work on the dimensions of the Bag End set where they shot the scenes for the ‚ÄúUnexpected Party‚Äù in The Hobbit.,"I‚Äôm sure there are very detailed dimensions/floor plans for the set of Bag End. I‚Äôve been spending the last year or so developing floor plans for a full Bag End (trying to make it ‚Äúhuman‚Äù sized, designing rooms we do see in the movies, and trying to make it practical for a real person to live in). I know there is a layout designed by Weta based on the movie but when you look closely it actually does not match up with what we see in the movie and what we see from the exterior on the real Bag End in New Zealand, also there are no measurements on the Weta layout. Also I know that awhile back Forbes actually calculated how much a human sized Bag End would cost to build so I‚Äôm not sure if there is a detailed floor plan from Forbes. I‚Äôve spent hours searching for floor plans from the Bag End set. My question for the community here is, does anybody have these floor plans or know how to find them? (There are probably some kind of copyrights or intellectual property issues I would have to deal with down the road if I were to actually build a real Bag End, but that‚Äôs an issue I‚Äôd have to deal with down the road.) 

Any information is greatly appreciated!! 
Thank you, all!!"

TheHobbit,Question about the book (possible spoilers if you haven‚Äôt read the book idk),"Hi everyone! 

I just recently got into reading the Tolkien books and finished The Hobbit not too long ago. Something that struck me as odd about the book was the anticlimactic killing of Smaug. The whole quest was based on Thorin and the crew going to the lonely mountain to kill Smaug and reclaim his kingdom. And Thorin as a character has huge incentive to kill Smaug since Smaug kicked his father and grandfather out of their kingdom. It seemed odd to me that this random Bard character we‚Äôve never seen before kills Smaug with a single arrow and seemingly not much effort and no big deal was ever made about that. I‚Äôd like to hear the community‚Äôs thoughts on this and maybe why Tolkien opted for this plot!"

TheHobbit,"Looking for a Hobbit trilogy rewrite fanfic involving closer Leg &amp; Thran relationship, and more negative Tauriel","I'm looking for a *Hobbit* fanfic that was a rewrite of PJ's second trilogy. It involves a much warmer relationship between Legolas and Thranduil, and portrays Tauriel in a more negative light. It was on either AO3 or FFN, and it had several chapters, although I don't remember if it was complete or not. I read it earlier this January, but since I do all my fic reading in Incognito I can't find it.

I remember the first chapter opens pre-movies, with everyone grieving after a patrol because an elf (an OC) was killed. Legolas and another elf are in the infirmary with broken ribs. Tauriel had defied orders to try out a new strategy of killing some spiders, and ended up getting the OC killed. The OC was someone who had a crush on Tauriel, and although she didn't return his feelings, she had ""toyed with"" his affections to get him to cooperate in her scheme. Tauriel is put on probation and forced to redo her training, and the next chapters cover Legolas and Thranduil running a kind of Xanatos Gambit and trying to prevent Tauriel from creating more trouble.

I also remember Galion has an OFC wife and several kids."

I have just started to read the Hobbit book.
I'm reading the book in my own native language which is not English. There was a part in the book which made me curious about something.

Right now, the dwarves are in Bilbo's home and Thorin has started to talk about their plans to get back the gold and all that. Bilbo panicked and there was a line which goes like ""Panick rose in Bilbo like the whistle of a locomotive that just came out the tunnel.""
This is a rough translation from my native language but the words whistle and locomotive and tunnel were used.

There were no trains in middle earth, so it doesn't make sense.
Who is the narrator of the book?

Thank you."

TheHobbit,I hope to change some people's minds,"I just need to get this off my chest. I believe that the hobbit trilogy is actually quite good and even a worthy predecessor of the LOTR trilogy and let me explain why I think this and let me address people's complaints that I have seen

As somebody who has seen all extended versions of both LOTR and The hobbit, watched their 12 hour long appendices (the making of them), read both series, and dabbled into the depths of the silmarillion, I like to think I have a decent knowledge of the series. 

1. The hypocrisy of LOTR and the hobbit movies. I hear people say that ""the hobbit isn't true to the book"". First, no book adaptation movie can be true to  their predecessors. It's a clash of story telling. Second, the LOTR is even more of an offense than the hobbit movies when if comes to ""following the books"". The LOTR movies are a very lose follow to the story with even major changes to characters like Galadrial and Borimir. They had to change these things because if they didn't, they would have to be 5 hour movies with 50% of it being singing! But people can say ""well the changes in the hobbit don't make sense"" well for a story telling stand point they do. The main change from book to movie is the reintroduction of azog. From a story telling standpoint, it made sense. They needed a reason to have the cast of characters to keep going. They needed a threat and azog fit nicely. I do understand that they could have used bolg and yeah they probably should have, but why is azog such a problem? 


2. The LOTR ""fanservice"". I really don't get this complaint. Reintroducing Elrond, bringing back legolas, mentioning gimli, and other ""fanservice"". It's not fanservice, it's an expansion of the universe. The lord of the rings was published after the hobbit and the things he introduced in that story should and probably would have been in the story in the first place. It just connects the world. Why is having a prequel mention its sequel such a problem? Why is connecting the world's in logical fashion such a bad idea? Christopher Lee thought it was a good idea, and he was friends WITH Tolkien. In the appendices, Christopher Lee mentions that he would not let Peter Jackson add something that he thought would be damaging to the genre. 

3. Legolas being in the hobbit and his role in it. First of all, if legolas had exsisted by the time the hobbit was finished, it would have made alot of sense for him to be present due to him being prince of the woodland realm. (Atleast in the movies) legolas has no arc in LOTR. He's just there to be a hero. He falls short compared to Aragorns arc. This is why he has such a long appearance in the hobbit movies. It's the start of his story that finishes by the time The two towers is done. Seeing Orlando Bloom progress as an actor is awesome to see in the hobbit, and I think he nails it. And don't get me STARTED on the ""legolas does stuff to defy physics in the hobbit movies"" bullshit. Apparently climbing a raging Oliphant, taking out all of the guys on it whilst balancing ON said Oliphan, and then neatly sliding down its trunk after he cuts off the saddle and head shots it is just 100% fine. Suspension of disbelief people! 


Let me just get this out too. Why would I be upset if they actually gave the dwarves and other characters actual character traits and development? In the book,  we get some information on thorin, kili, fili, and maybe a little bit about the others other than ""they can start fires"". In the movies the dwarves are each given distinct personalities that make the world of Tolkien even more colorful than before. Bilbo is amazingly portrayed by Martin freeman. Characters like Bard actually are portrayed as characters with development. The reason Gandalf leaves during the hobbit is explained by Tolkien, but not in the hobbit. They just took the liberty to add it in to make more sense when it comes to movies storytelling

The one thing I have a serious gripe about is the love triangle. Even still it fleshes more characters out than the books ever did. 

I have a lot more to say on this if anyone is interested, but this is getting long.

I think the trilogy perfectly captures the crazy and insane shenanigans that I imagined when I read them as a kid (maybe a little more violent then I remember) and represents the Tolkien genre very well. 

(Keep in mind that the trilogy is not perfect)"
TheHobbit,I Love The Hobbit Trilogy! (a brief essay about my experience with the movies),"I thought I'd share some positivity and my experience with these lovely films. I have a fairly unique experience with these movies. Up until about three years ago, I had never seen The Hobbit movies, I had never seen any of The Lord of the Rings movies, I had never read any of the books. I knew basically nothing about Tolkien's world. My then girlfriend (now wife!) was very into Tolkien and she excitedly introduced me to this world. We started with The Hobbit movies and I instantly fell in love. The beautiful world, the exciting set pieces, the fun, lighthearted moments mixed in with darker and more serious ones. I was hooked and immediately a lifelong fan. Then, I went online. There seemed to be no positivity about the Hobbit movies, just constant complaints. And it was really just the same few complaints echoed over and over again. Too much CGI, not faithful to the book, pointless love triangle, over-bloated with side plots, the action was too cartoony. We've all heard it before. I felt like everyone was overlooking all of the great aspects of these films and focusing solely on a the few negative ones. Were these few things really enough to spoil the entire trilogy for so many people? I think people are just drawn to negativity. It was cool to hate. It was cool to point out the flaws. 

Was there too much CGI? Maybe, but to me, having not seen LOTR, it was just part of the ""look"" of the world. It was colorful and fun. Was it not faithful to the book? I didn't know or particularly care; I had never read the book so that wasn't really relevant to me. Plus I've never really understood why being faithful to the source material is the be-all-end-all for some people. I don't really care as long as it's a good movie. Isn't The Shining, widely considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time, completely different than it's source material. But I digress. Was the love triangle pointless? I mean it wasn't my favorite aspect of the film but it didn't necessarily feel shoved in to me like so many people seemed to think. It was just one aspect of a very large story. I quite liked Tauriel and Kili and their relationship was the beginning of the end of the blind hate between Elves and Dwarves. Maybe it wasn't super well done, but to me it at least felt well intentioned. And while I agree that the movie deviated too often from the main plot, and I didn't love all of the side characters, I was just happy to be living in this world for a little bit longer. The extra stuff didn't detract from how good the main stuff was in my eyes. And I didn't think the action was too cartoony at all. It was certainly way over the top. But again this was a fantasy world. The movies had singing in them. It was thrilling and felt like something I would've absolutely loved as a kid. In many ways the tone reminded me of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies (which I also thoroughly enjoy). 

I think my perspective was significantly helped by the fact that I went in with no expectations, no previously conceived notions about what these movies would be like or how they *should* be. I'm glad I saw The Hobbit before watching LOTR. Of course I watched that trilogy next, and I absolutely loved it. But it was just different from The Hobbit. Same world, different tone. And I wouldn't have it any other way. 

I realize that this post is about 7 years too late. But I just wanted to share my experience and some positivity about this lovely trilogy. It makes me sad that so many people write off these movies. Hopefully some of you guys are like me: able to enjoy them for what they are rather than criticizing them for what they're not."

TheHobbit,Thorin appreciation post,"I'm rewatching the Hobbit (extended editions) for the fist time in a couple years and something struck me.

Throughout the film's, Thorin clearly and accurately calls each of the dwarves by name. I especially noticed this when Ori was about to run out of cover during the warg chase and Thorin grabs him while yelling ""Ori no!"".

Although I can't be sure, this commitment to each character's name feels like a deliberate choice by Richard Armitage (Thorin's actor), and showcases the comradery that the company has.

I'm not a huge fan of these movies, although I do clearly enjoy them enough to own them, but little details like these shows the love and care that members of the cast and crew had for the project."

Anyway, I'm planning to do a proper dive through the series, reading these with a family member, so I wanted to make sure I had all the essentials. We've got LOTR with its appendices, The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion. I want to have all my lore information on-hand.

However, I thought I remember hearing more recently that The Hobbit had its own appendix. But as I said, my copy doesn't have one, so I've been pondering whether I should buy another copy, but I can't seem to find any information about this when I search it. So I thought maybe someone here knew more.

Also, as an aside: are there any other Middle-earth essentials to the canon that you would recommend purchasing?"

Then a minute later, after Azog's wolf mauls Thorin and throws him aside, Azog has the opportunity to finish him off. Instead, he tells one of the orcs ""Bring me his head,"" which contradicts what he just said a minute before.

It seems to me like the writers are just trying to make him sound like an edgy villain and don't know what his motivations are."

I don't know if it's the new dolby vision HDR or if it's been tweaked, but the melted gold looked WAY better to me this time around. I'm by no means a professional here, and this is just on first viewing. So I'd like to see if anybody had a similar or different experience.

TheHobbit,How to fix the love relationship between Kili and Tauriel,"I‚Äôm probably one of the few who actually liked the love relationship between Kili and Tauriel. But I have to admit: it was poor and cheesy!
The love was good. A little bit poetic. But the fact that it was squised down into just two encounters, made it pretty weird. Especially since Tauriel betrayed her own people and pointed an arrow to her kings head for a dwarf she met twice.
But here is how I would fix it.

Kili and Tauriel should have been old lovers!
In the books, some of the dwarfes were far over 100 years old. So let‚Äôs say that Kili is about 100 years old. I don‚Äôt know so much about regular Elf age. But let‚Äôs just say that Tauriel is 500 years old. 
And they were together for maybe 50 years ago, But they had to break up because of the duty to their own people. And maybe they were together for 1 day, 1 week, 1 year or even 1 decade. And their love is pretty Shakespare poetic, and they were deeply in love. Maybe that stone conversation from the prison is a Flash back to how they met. And when they meet eachother again in the prison, they are both trying to fight their feelings for eachother. But they do have one deeply conversation in the prison. That‚Äôs why she is so desperate to try and save him. And that‚Äôs why Kili thinks she is so far away.

I think this version works because then they have been together for a long time before. And they both have had many decades to understand if this was true love or not.
What do you think? I really liked the idea. But if You‚Äôre only going to say that you didn‚Äôt want the love triangle at all, you can just drop it for now.

Thanks for listening"

Best character ever in the franchise. What a glorious dragon, evil and arrogant and stunning. His CGI was fantastic, he was electrifying.",
TheHobbit,The overuse of the Willhelm scream is stupid and breaks the immersion of the movie.,I was on my second watch of The Desolation of Smaug and I was at the scene where Thrain is telling Gandalf to tell Thorin that he loved him and then he is caltured by The Necromancer of Dol Guldur and I heard that godforsaken Willhelm scream. It completely took me out of the moment for the second time and ruins a could have been great emotional part of the movie. Whoever thought it was a great idea to implement the Willhelm scream into such a moment should never be able to work on sound for any movie ever.
TheHobbit,We should all donate to Maple films right tf now.,"Love or hate the Hobbit films, we all know that there is a lot we would change if we were given the chance. While the best most of us have is our imaginations and arguments with friends, u/eldusto84 has made a fan edit that, in my opinion, surpasses all others. Other edits, such as the Tolkien Edit or There and Back Again, either cut out too much or leave too much in. However, at least for me, JRR Tolkien‚Äôs The Hobbit is the closest to the book and the most enjoyable way to watch the Hobbit. u/eldusto84 has edited all three extended editions of the films down into one, 4-hour film with an intermission (Don‚Äôt you wish more longer modern films had intermissions, by the way? What happened to them?) 

He‚Äôs created Blu-ray ISO files of his edit, along with disc art, cover art and menus, so you could have a physical copy and have it look just as professional as the original Blu-Ray release. And, all of this for free (minus the cost of a rw Blu-Ray and a case)

You can look at a full list of the changes he‚Äôs made [here](http://www.maple-films.com/faq.html).

However, with the 4K release of The Hobbit Trilogy a few weeks ago, he‚Äôs been inundated with requests to update his edit. 

Today he told me that he‚Äôs hesitant of restarting the project in 4K as he already spent hundreds of hours on the Blu-Ray version with very little profit besides what‚Äôs been donated.

So, if you‚Äôd like to see an excellent fanedit of The Hobbit Trilogy in 4K I entreat you to [donate](http://www.maple-films.com/donate.html) however much you can. 

Plus, it‚Äôd make a really cool Christmas gift."
